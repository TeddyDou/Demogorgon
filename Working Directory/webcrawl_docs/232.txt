Strategic Directions
OUR 9
STRATEGIC DIRECTIONS
are bold, daring, innovative and transformative.
Concordia’s nine strategic directions focus on how we can thrive as a next-generation university in a changing landscape and stay true to our core values and historic mission.
 
We’ve developed a game plan that identifies a slate of priority activities that emerged after reflection, deliberation and planning across the university in the 2015-16 academic year.
 
We’ve begun to rollout initiatives in 2016-17 under our nine “first moves.”
 
Take a look at what we’re doing.
