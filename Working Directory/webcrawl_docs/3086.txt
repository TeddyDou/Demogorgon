about cinema politica Concordia
Cinema Politica is a media arts, non-profit network of community and campus locals that screen independent political film and video by Canadian and international artists throughout Canada and abroad. Cinema Politica's biggest and longest running local was founded at Concordia University, Montreal in 2004 and ever since it attracts between 300 and 600 people to its weekly screenings. Each semester programming is focused around themes that touch on social justice, environmental and cultural identity issues, and all screenings aim to bridge political independent filmmaking, local activism and civic education and engagement. Cinema Poltica Concordia is administered by the Concordia Cinema Politica Student Association (CCPSA) which is a legally incorporated non-profit fee-levy group funded by undergraduate and graduate students at Concordia.
All our screenings occur during the Fall and Winter semesters and take place on Mondays @ 7:00 pm in Room H110, at 1455 de Maisonneuve W. with a few exceptions. All screenings are BY DONATION and open to the public, and are followed by discussions or Q&As with filmmakers and/or local organizers.
If you want to GET INVOLVED or simply learn more about what we do and how we do it, please concordia [at] cinemapolitica [dot] org (email us) or come to our screenings and talk to the organizers.

Cinema Politica Concordia Territorial Acknowledgement (Montreal)
We would like to acknowledge that we gather on the traditional territory of the Iroquois people, the Haudenosaunee. Indigenous peoples are the original title-holders and stewards of these lands and waters. The CP team believes it is not enough to only acknowledge the keepers of the land. We encourage everyone who attends our screenings to become informed and involved in anti-colonial and Indigenous struggles and resistance. Wherever Indigenous peoples are protecting and reasserting control over their territories today, they are at the frontline of our collective struggle to protect and steward our planet. Thank you.
