The carousel above is updated daily to feature ten different books from our new acquisitions RSS feeds . These feeds are updated every night with the latest material acquired by Concordia University Library.  To find recent items on a particular topic you can search CLUES by keyword or subject and then use the limit by publication year option. Your subject librarian may also be of assistance in establishing a list of search terms appropriate to your area of interest.
