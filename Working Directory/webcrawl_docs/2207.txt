I                                  received a BA (Honours) in Psychology   from York                                  University, Toronto in 1974   and an MA in Psychology                                  (Developmental)   from the University of Western                                  Ontario   in 1977. My MA program included a specialization                                    in early childhood education and I spent many                                    hours working in the University Laboratory Nursery                                    School under the supervision of Dr. Mary   J. Wright.                                  Following the MA I spent   five long years living                                  in Edmonton,   Alberta. I worked as an Assistant                                    Supervisor, Edmonton Northwest Day Care Center,                                    which was a municipally funded day care center.                                    I also completed a post-degree program in Elementary                                    Education at the University of Alberta   and after                                  two years of teaching I   received my professional                                  certification   as an elementary school teacher.                                  During   one year I was a counsellor in an elementary                                    school and in the second year, I taught a special                                    education class. Subsequently I attended the   University                                  of Waterloo and completed my   Ph.D. in Developmental                                  Psychology in   1986. I have been a member of the                                    Education Department, Concordia, ever since. In                                    1998 I was a visiting scholar at Lancaster University,                                    England.

Research interests and current projects
Co-construction                                      of meaning in the sibling relationship: Beginning with my dissertation, my   research                                    has been concerned with the   longitudinal nature                                    of the quality of   sibling relations, the influence                                    of   the mother on the children's relationship                                      and self_disclosure between siblings. Furthermore,                                      I am interested in how siblings co-construct                                      meaning in their relationship through play,                                      caretaking, teaching and use of   internal state                                    language (i.e.,   references to emotional, mental                                      states). Recently my work has focussed on young                                      children's social knowledge and understanding                                      of the sibling relationship, particularly within                                      the pretend play context. Currently I am   examining                                    the relations between   children pretense negotiations                                    and   conflict resolution, as well as the development                                      of intersubjectivity in sibling play and associations                                      with the quality of the relationship.   Another                                    project is investigating the   associations between                                    disclosure,   intimacy, and the quality of children                                      peer relationships in middle childhood. My current                                      SSHRC-funded project is to examine sibling teaching                                      from a social-constructivist framework.
Influence of the design of dramatic play                                      centers on children's play: How the ecology of the early childhood classroom,                                      specifically dramatic play centers, affects                                      children's social and cognitive play.   This project                                    has both a theoretical   and applied focus. Based                                    on theory   regarding the importance of pretend                                      play in young children's development, I have                                      conducted a series of studies to determine how                                      to facilitate opportunities for dramatic play                                      in the early childhood classroom. Several of                                      my MA students have investigated   other aspects                                    of play, such as the   relationship between solitary                                    play   and children thinking styles or the influence                                      of different kinds of play materials (e.g.,                                      superhero or scripted toys) on children.
Child care: Specifically recent                                      child care research and implications for Canadian                                      public policy. The majority of recent research                                      on child care emanates from the United   States, however the Canadian context   differs from the                                    American in   significant economic and philosophical                                      ways. My work (with E. Jacobs) has pointed to                                      the importance of considering these differences                                      for the development of child care policy.   Professor                                    Jacobs and I are currently   engaged in a pan-Canadian                                    study of   curriculum in child care settings funded                                      through Human Resources Development Canada.                                      Specifically we are looking at provincial regulations                                      and guidelines for curriculum in child care                                      settings and how curriculum is taught   to future                                    educators enrolled in   community colleges. We                                    will also   conduct an inservice intervention                                      program focused on constructivist curriculum                                      for child care workers in three provinces (Manitoba,                                      Nova Scotia, Quebec). Finally, I have co-edited                                      a book (with L. Prochner) titled   Early Childhood                                    Care and Education in   Canada, which includes                                    historical   developments, current trends, and                                      future directions in Canadian early childhood                                      education.
