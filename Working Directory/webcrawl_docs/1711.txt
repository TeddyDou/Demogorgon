American donors
Donors residing in the United States have two giving options:
If you are a Concordia graduate, or a member of a student or graduateâ€™s immediate family, you can give directly to the university and use the Concordia donation receipt when filing your U.S. income tax return.
If you did not attend Concordia (or don't have a family member who is a Concordia student or graduate) and you wish to receive a donation receipt for U.S. tax purposes, please donate to the American Friends of Concordia University, an independent charity in the United States created to advance the mission of Concordia University.
Mail your cheque, payable to American Friends of Concordia University, to the following address and suggest an area that you would like your donation to support.
