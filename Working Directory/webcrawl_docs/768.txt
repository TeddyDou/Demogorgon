Philosophy Speaker Series: Bela Egyed
"Plato, Hegel and the Crisis of Liberalism"
November 24, 2017, 3 p.m. – 5 p.m.
Abstract
In this talk I will argue that attacks on Plato and Hegel by liberals have been misguided because they were based on a narrow (negative) conception of liberties. My main focus in this talk will be on Hegel’s Philosophy of Right. I will begin by examining his criticism of Plato, arguing that his political philosophy is caught between Plato’s communitarianism and 17th century possessive individualism, and, for that reason, his version of liberalism is still fraught with ambiguities. Nevertheless, interpreted generously, Hegel’s conception of “rational freedom”, and of the “rational state’, might offer a means of overcoming the false alternative between “liberalism” and “conservatism” as they are understood today. In short, my view is that the present crisis of liberalism is largely self-inflicted: a result of having made promises it could not keep. The question is whether this crisis can be overcome by following Hegel’s rational reconstruction of modern liberalism, or whether it is a symptom of a radically new form of life to come.
