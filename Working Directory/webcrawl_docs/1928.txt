Biology (MSc)
Master of Science (MSc)
Offered by:
Department of Biology , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why pursue a Master's in Biology?
The Master of Science (Biology) is a research-intensive program, which places a heavy emphasis on creativity and innovation yet remains firmly grounded in fundamental science.  Working closely with a faculty mentor, you will develop a mastery of modern research methodologies while expanding your disciplinary knowledge, analytical skills and critical thinking.  You will also develop an in-depth understanding of current scientific literature and enhanced communication skills.  Our program gives students the training, knowledge and techniques to become effective and engaged scientists.
Our faculty members are internationally known for their work across a wide spectrum of biological sciences. The breadth of our department and cognate programs offers a diverse range of disciplinary and cross-disciplinary research opportunities.
Areas of research conducted within our Department include:
Animal Biology and Behaviour
Cellular and Developmental Biology and Biochemistry
Ecology, Evolution and Conservation Biology
Microbiology
Microscopy
Molecular Biology and Genomics
Plant Biochemistry and Biotechnology
Synthetic Biology
Thrive in Montreal, a major centre for academic and applied research. We have four universities (and affiliated research centres) and Federal and Provincial Government research agencies as well as private companies engaged in partnerships with academic researchers.
