Canada Research Chairs
Concordia University recognizes and values the role played by Research Chairs (“Chairholders”) in creating and mobilizing knowledge with the aim of achieving research excellence. As leaders in their fields, Chairholders play a critical role in deepening our knowledge base and in strengthening our teaching, the training of highly qualified personnel, and research capacity. As catalysts and builders, they contribute to the university's positioning in given areas of scholarly pursuit and to the enhancement of the research training environment.
