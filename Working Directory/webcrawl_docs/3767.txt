Marketing (BComm)
Bachelor of Commerce (BComm)
Offered by:
Department of Marketing , John Molson School of Business
Why study Marketing?
Marketing is the art of persuasion: how to convey ideas, manage buzz and create desire. You persuade people to do things like: buy a car or vote for a politician. And it doesn’t matter if you sell smart phones or sustainable living, you’ll learn the strategies, tactics and measurements behind influencing consumer choices.
During your degree, you develop decision-making skills, exercise your creative mind and study consumer behaviour. You’ll also:
Examine current marketing theories and practices
Identify the information needed to tackle marketing problems
Develop an ability to adapt to constantly changing marketing environments
Hone your communication and personal-selling skills
Learn to analyze market metrics and other types of marketing data
JMSB’s applied approach gives you the tools to succeed in the marketplace after graduation. You will leave with the knowledge, skill and attitude to be an advertising account manager, market researcher or social media specialist, or to take on any number of marketing careers this versatile degree offers you.
Program details
