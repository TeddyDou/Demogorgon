Education
D.Phil. Cultural Studies. University of Oxford.
Research Interests
The winner of two Commonwealth Scholarships and a SSHRC Postdoctoral Fellowship, Marc earned his undergraduate degree in Sociology at the University of Ottawa and his masters and doctoral degrees in Cultural Studies at the University of Oxford. Drawing on his background in both the Social Sciences and the Humanities, he works in a field that has come to be known as “Cultural Sociology.”
Marc’s research program is characterised by two areas of enquiry: popular media culture and contemporary cultural theory. In his work on popular media culture, he explores representations of gender, sexuality, race, class and ability and how they are bound up with issues of self, body and society. Looking at television, magazines and popular music, he considers what these representations can be seen to communicate about broader social conflicts, relations and structures. Marc has become especially well-known for his research on the emergence of “multiple masculinities” and the so-called “crisis of masculinity” as well as for his work on violence against men in the media. Marc’s work has been published in a number of high impact journals and book collections. It has also earned him two SSHRC Insight grants, which he shares with his longstanding research partner Professor Lori Burns of the University of Ottawa.
In his work on contemporary cultural theory, Marc concentrates on present-day debates pertaining to subjectivity an embodiment. Through critical readings of twentieth-century poststructural and psychoanalytic texts, he aims to provide cultural theorists with new tools for making sense of embodied subjectivity. To this end, he has published on philosopher Michel Foucault and has been internationally recognized for his work on psychoanalyst Didier Anzieu and the “psychoanalysis of skin.” This work was featured in a special section of the peer-reviewed journal Body and Society and was showcased by the Walrus Talks Speaker Series on “Being Human.”
Marc prides himself on being a public intellectual. He has, for instance, served as a monthly commentator on Société Radio-Canada’s premiere morning show Médium large (2013-2015), has consulted for the National Film Board of Canada (2014) and has appeared on popular current affairs shows such as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's The Current. He will soon be featured on Télé-Québec's well-known series Banc public as well as in two French-language documentaries: one on men and masculinity and the other on body image and body modification. He receives regular interview requests from prominent radio, television and print media news outlets throughout Quebec and Canada.
