Physics (BSc)
Bachelor of Science (BSc)
Offered by:
Department of Physics , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why study Physics?
Studying Physics sends you on a journey to the end of the universe or into the centre of an atom. When you study the science of energy and matter, you examine the dynamics of a relationship that has kept great thinkers busy for millennia. Today physicists build lasers, design medical imaging machines and develop applications for nanotechnology. So if you’re ready, sharpen your reasoning skills and open your mind — physics is a discipline that demands as much curiosity as it does strength in mathematics.
As a Physics student, you’ll choose the Physics option, or examine the role of physics in the life sciences in the Biophysics option. You’ll receive a thorough foundation in all branches of physics, including mathematics, classical mechanics, electricity and magnetism, waves and optics, quantum mechanics and modern and theoretical physics.
Graduates leave the program with the knowledge and creative thinking skills required for graduate studies or a career in the pure or life sciences.
Program Details
Degree options
A Bachelor of Science degree takes a minimum of three or four years (90 – 120 credits) of full-time study, depending on your academic background .
Options:
Honours in Physics – Physics option (69 credits)*
Honours in Physics – Biophysics option (69 credits)*
Specialization in Physics – Physics option (66 credits)
Specialization in Physics – Biophysics option (66 credits)
Major in Physics (45 credits)
*Admission is to the major or specializations. Students may apply to honours after 24 program credits.
See full degree requirements in the undergraduate calendar .
Admission requirements
Additional Math / Science Courses
CEGEP STUDENTS: Calculus 1 and Calculus 2 and Linear Algebra – Mechanics, Electricity and Magnetism and Wave, Optics and Modern Physics – General Chemistry and Chemistry of Solutions – General Biology OR Natural Science DEC OR DEC intégré en sciences, lettres et arts.
CANADIAN HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS: one math – two of biology, chemistry, physics
BACC. FRANÇAIS STUDENTS: Science programs require the completion of Série S (Sciences) Bacc. Français
Note: Special attention is paid to Math and Science grades. Applicants missing some of the course prerequisites may still be eligible for admission.
Minimum Cut-off Averages
Minimum cut-off averages should be used as indicators. The cut-off data may change depending on the applicant pool. Applicants who meet the stated minimum requirements are not guaranteed admission to these programs.

September 1
Not all programs are available for this term. Please check  program availability .
We reserve the right to close admission to a program at any time after the official deadline without prior notice.
 
Course curriculum
Sample classes include:
Methods of Theoretical Physics
Electricity and Magnetism
Modern Physics and Relativity
Quantum Mechanics
Membrane Biophysics
Consult the undergraduate calendar for a complete list of current courses, view suggested class schedules or see our core program on the Physics website.
After your degree
Many Physics alumni pursue graduate studies and work at the forefront of technological innovation. They have established careers in a variety of scientific fields that include:
Nanotechnology
Medical imaging and radiation treatment
Energy
Telecommunications
Laser and satellite design
Learn more about your career options .
Co-op program
The Co-op program gives you the chance to complete paid work terms that last 12 to 16 weeks. As a Co-op student, you will work for firms where you may:
Perform spectroscopy work
Take measurements of solar cells
Develop software or computer interfacing protocols
Develop models to predict the behaviour of lasers and optics systems
Test survey hypotheses
Students interested in applying for the Physics co-op should refer to  section 24 of the Undergraduate Calendar where a full description of the admission requirements is provided.
Academic content is very similar to that of the regular programs, with some specific recommendations for courses to improve the students' job skills. While it is hoped that most of the positions will be in the Montreal area, students must be prepared to work in other parts of Canada.
Students are supervised personally and must meet the requirements specified by the Faculty of Arts and Science and the Institute for Co-operative Education in order to continue their studies in the co-op format.
Liaison between the student, the employers, and the Institute for Co-operative Education is provided by the Physics co-op committee, which includes the student's advisors.
