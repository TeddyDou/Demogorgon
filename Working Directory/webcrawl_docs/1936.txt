Digital Innovation in Journalism Studies (MA)
Master of Arts (MA)
Offered by:
Department of Journalism , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why pursue a Master’s in Digital Innovation in Journalism Studies?
Invigorate your passion for journalism by exploring the digital ramifications of a rapidly evolving segment of the media landscape. Our one-of-a kind Master’s program pushes the boundaries of research into the future of journalism with a unique focus on digital innovation, or new approaches to journalism practice. Through seminars and lab sessions, you’ll develop critical thinking skills to enhance your understanding of how digital storytelling intersects with, and redefines traditional mediums such as print, television and radio. 
Over a period of two-years, you’ll gain training in digital journalism skills combined with a strong research foundation in how to study and experiment with factual storytelling and projected journalism futures. With the guidance of our acclaimed faculty members , this combination of theory and practice will equip you with the skills to produce an innovative graduate thesis or essay.
Our MA program is grounded in both traditional and contemporary frameworks of journalism studies scholarship. It seeks to propel next generation researchers—those who are truth seekers, storytellers and makers of change—to innovate in the digital media space of today and tomorrow.
