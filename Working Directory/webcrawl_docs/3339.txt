Was busy with animation work so I didn’t have the chance to create new artwork, but here’s something I’d been meaning to post on here anyway. The bottom character was actually an unused design for an animating exercise, go figure

Have an awesome, safe Halloween, everybody!!!

I’m having an artwork put up for some vernissage here in Montreal. Based on an idea I’d been toying with for a while, but wait for deets on that in the future, true believers ;)

Way back in October, I was asked to do cover art for an acquaintance’s rap album (he goes by the name P.Flow Matics, check out his page:  https://www.facebook.com/pflowmaticshiphop ) 
I only had a week to do it. They took a picture and told me to use a style I had worked with for a project back in college (essentially tracing it). It seemed simple enough, so why not? I CAN DO THIS ALONGSIDE MY SCHOOL WORK.
What a young, naive fool I was.
But in all seriousness, glad I did it, and I got to experiment with a different look.

Here’s the zine in full, as promised! We’ll still be highlighting individual contributors and hooking you guys up with links to the rest of their work, but for now, we’ll skip the teasing and just give you the full package! Enjoy!

Hey all, check out all the damn fine art in this exquisite little zine of ours, TOTUM. I’ll be sharing my own comic from collection soon!
And any of you cool cats who happen to be living in Montreal, go and pick up a copy at Drawn and Quarterly for $7
