About the research
Dr. Lisa Kakinami from the Department of Mathematics and Statistics (in collaboration with the  PERFORM Centre ) is offering at least one MSc Fellowship in Biostatistics for students applying to Concordia University’s MSc in Mathematics and Statistics. The student(s) will join a multidisciplinary team of epidemiologists, statisticians and psychologists investigating behavioural and psychological predictors of obesity and cardiovascular disease risk across the lifespan.
Broadly, Dr. Kakinami’s research aims to not only improve our understanding of the complex relationships between social determinants, environment, and behaviours to differentially affect obesity and cardiometabolic risk across the lifespan, but to also address important methodological and statistical limitations of the existing obesity and health-related literature. In particular, four specific areas of research are currently being explored: (1) the role of compensatory behaviours in maintaining a weight loss goal; (2) the bidirectional and interactive ways in which children’s characteristics may affect their social environment and their obesity risk; (3) the modeling of children’s growth over time; and (4) the methodological uncertainties of measuring the built environment’s impact on health.
The thesis will apply a combination of epidemiological methods and data analysis to explore one of the research areas above. The candidate(s) will be trained on the necessary procedures relevant for this research including (but not limited to): statistical data analysis (cross-sectional and/or longitudinal) and structural equation modeling. The successful candidate(s) will have opportunities to present at national conferences and author manuscript(s) based on their research. Additional collaborations with students and faculty on other obesity or cardiovascular related research are also possible.
Financial Commitment
The selected candidate(s) will be offered a competitive funding package which is designed to cover tuition and living expenses.  The total financial package may consist of Research Assistantship Bursaries, Teaching Assistantships, and University awards such as the Concordia University Graduate Fellowship (PhD), Concordia International Tuition Award of Excellence, and additional scholarships and bursaries.  Students admitted to the MSc/MA receive funding for 2 years and PhD students receive funding for up to 4 years, subject to satisfactory performance.
