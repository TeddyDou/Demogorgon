FAS 2025: Strategic Directions for Arts and Science
THE LEARNING FROM OTHERS PROJECT
To become a national powerhouse of interdisciplinarity, we are providing opportunities for faculty, students and staff to teach and learn from one another â€“ across departments, across Faculties and with other institutions. 
Give us your suggestions so that we can reach beyond traditional mentorship and facilitate collaboration in teaching, learning and research.
These include:
a high-profile speaker series
a program of mobility initiatives for students and faculty
learning from alumni by connecting them with current students
mentorship programs for students, staff and faculty involving community partners 
a new FAS co-op and internship program
testing and developing projects for lifelong learning and professional development
