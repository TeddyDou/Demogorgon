Communication Studies (GrDip)
Graduate Diploma (GrDip)
Offered by:
Department of Communication Studies , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why pursue a Graduate Diploma in Communication Studies?
Students experience an intensive introduction to the field of communications for one year, full-time. Because no previous academic training or experience is required - just a Bachelor’s degree in a field other than communication - it is perfect for those seeking a career change or upgrading qualifications. The Graduate Diploma is an interdisciplinary gathering of students from diverse professional backgrounds, offering film, video, intermedia, and sound production, as well as communications and media theory courses. A 3-credit Internship option is available for students finding their own work placement.
Our Graduate Diploma program is ideal for students wanting to develop their media production skills and understanding of communication theory in just one year of full-time study. As a Graduate Diploma student, you will have the opportunity to:
work in hands-on production courses in sound, intermedia and video/film,
take a range of courses related to the theoretical aspects of communication;
have the option of undertaking a hands-on internship opportunity while you study;
learn from a dedicated faculty of distinguished researchers and creators.
