Western Society and Culture (BA)
Bachelor of Arts (BA)
Offered by:
Liberal Arts College , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why study Western Society and Culture?
A liberal arts education equips you for life. The Western Society and Culture program teaches you to think critically, enhance your communication skills and become a more resourceful, innovative and self-confident person.
You’ll join a small community of scholars to study the great works of Western Civilization. Our carefully constructed seminars guide you through the foundations and development of Western civilization and culture.
We aim to foster an intimate intellectual community by organizing many stimulating events, projects and trips. You’ll attend coffee hour as well as formal dinners, put on talent shows, publish a journal of academic and creative work and travel to New York or Europe to visit museums and galleries.
The Major in Western Society and Culture is designed so you may pursue our honours program. It can also be easily combined with another arts or science major. Either way, you will take part in a stimulating study of human nature and society. We guarantee this program will challenge your worldview and provoke critical reflection on where you stand.
