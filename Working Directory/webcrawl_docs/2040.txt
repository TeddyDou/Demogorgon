Dr. Marguerite Mendell
Director
Karl Polanyi Institute of Political Economy
Dr. Marguerite Mendell
Concordia economist Marguerite Mendell is committed to partnership research, or to what she refers to as the "co-construction of knowledge." For more than two decades, Mendell has collaborated with practitioners in community economic development, the social economy and the growing social finance sector, resulting in important innovations in public policy.
At the School of Community and Public Affairs, she has brought this methodology to her students, engaging them in community based research. Her work on the social economy and social finance in Quebec has generated international interest and is part of an ongoing dialogue on innovative economic initiatives to reduce poverty and develop new collective forms of wealth creation. Mendell is also the co-founder of the Karl Polanyi Institute of Political Economy established at Concordia University in 1988.
With Kari Polanyi-Levitt, the daughter of Karl Polanyi, she created the Karl Polanyi Archive, an extraordinary research tool for scholars in all disciplines interested in and inspired by the work of Karl Polanyi, considered one of the ten most important thinkers of the 20th century. The global financial crisis and impending world recession have increased the importance of the work of Karl Polanyi today.
