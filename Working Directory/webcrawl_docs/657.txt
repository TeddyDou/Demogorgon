Netname account management
Concordia's netname account allows access to content and services based on the user's relationship to the University.
Netname accounts are granted by Concordia and used for access to email, wireless, campus computers, and other major computer systems. Most commonly, the netname account is used to access the MyConcordia portal and all the services found therein. 
Who can use it?
Students, alumni, and applicants, as well as faculty, staff, and retirees
How much does it cost?
There is no cost associated with this service.
How to get it
Students, alumni, and those who have submitted and finalized an application through Connect2Concordia  are automatically given a netname.
Employees must create a netname by proceeding to the  Activation  page on the MyConcordia portal and filling out the information requested.  
To reset your password, visit the MyConcordia Forgot password page and select the option that best suits you.

FAQ

Why has my account been disabled?
Netname accounts that are created but never used or are inactive for an extended period of time will be disabled for security purposes. If you still have access to the email address and basic personal information on file with Concordia, you can use the enabling feature (available on the portal when the 'Your account has been disabled' error is shown) to access your account.
If you require access to the account but are unable to use the enabling feature, contact the Service Desk .
I am an employee and am unable to access the MyConcordia portal. What should I do?
If you are unable to log in to your portal after trying the above steps, bring photo ID to the Service Desk (H-925, Sir George Williams Campus) or the Loyola Service Centre (CC-207, Loyola Campus). The hours are listed on the  Get help  page.
Service Desk staff is unable to reset passwords or provide personal information by phone or email. For in person assistance, visit the Service Desk at H-925.
I don't know my ID number (required for certain netname services). How can I retrieve it?
Your student or employee ID can be found on your ID card, your admissions e-mail, or any official documents you may have received from Concordia. Students can also find their ID number by accessing the Student Information System (SIS) through the MyConcordia portal and clicking on “Demographic Information” at the bottom of the page.
If you are unable to locate your ID number, bring photo ID to the Service Desk ( H-925, Sir George Williams Campus ) or the Loyola Service Centre ( CC-207, Loyola Campus ). The operating hours for all support locations are listed on the  Get help  page. The Service Desk is unable to provide personal information by phone or email.
Keep in mind that student ID numbers are only generated when an application has been submitted and finalized.
Can I change my netname?
Netnames are computer generated based on your legal name upon acceptance to Concordia as staff, faculty, or student, or upon submission of an application for admission.  As they are used for many of Concordia's systems, netnames can only be changed in the event of a legal name change.
