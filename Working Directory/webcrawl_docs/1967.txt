Psychology (MA)
Master of Arts (MA)
Offered by:
Department of Psychology , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why pursue a Master's in Psychology?
Gain access to excellent facilities that will enable you to pursue publishable research in various fields of psychology. Develop skills in scientific writing and presentation in order to better communicate your findings with other psychology experts.
The MA in Psychology provides a collegial learning environment where you will have the opportunity to engage in major areas of psychological research, including behavioural neuroscience , clinical and health research , cognitive science , and human development and developmental processes .  Our world-class faculty members are affiliated with a wide range of research labs , giving you unprecedented access to a critical mass of scholars who share common research interests.
Choose from one of two program options based on your own professional and academic objectives. Students in the Research Option receive rigorous training in psychological research that can lead to positions in academia or industry. The Research and Clinical Training Option is best suited for students who are interested in both conducting research and pursuing careers as clinical psychologists. Graduates from the Research and Clinical Training Option also receive a Diploma in Clinical Psychology upon completion of their degree. Students who enrol in the MA Psychology program normally advance to the PhD program after either one or two years of study.
Program details
Program options & degree requirements
Two program options exist. The Research Option emphasizes independent research and scholarship, and prepares students for research careers. Students in the Research and Clinical Training Option fulfill the same research requirements as other students, but also receive professional training in the delivery of psychological services.
Consult the graduate calendar for complete degree requirements.
Admission requirements
Admission Requirements. Admission to the PhD degree requires a master’s degree in psychology from a recognized university. Admission to the MA degree requires an honours degree in psychology or its equivalent. Enrolment in these programs is limited in part by the availability of research supervisors and, for the Research and Clinical Training Option, by space in that option.
Applicants are selected on the basis of past academic record, letters of recommendation, the results of the Graduate Record Examination (optional, but highly recommended), and the relevance of their proposed research to the research expertise of the faculty. Students successfully completing their master’s program in psychology at Concordia University need submit only an application form and letters of recommendation when applying for the doctoral degree. Psychology graduate courses are not open to graduate-level independent students, except in specific circumstances as defined by the department.
Upon recommendation of their thesis supervisor, students enrolled in the Master of Arts (Psychology) program at Concordia University who have completed a minimum of 12 credits of graduate level course work and who have shown high academic performance and potential through performance in research may apply for accelerated admission to doctoral studies without submitting a master’s thesis. Approval for accelerated admission must be obtained from the student’s thesis committee and the graduate admissions subcommittee by August 15 to allow entry into the PhD program in the Fall term. Students in the Research and Clinical Training option may not obtain accelerated admission to the PhD program from MA Year I, but may apply for accelerated admission, upon recommendation of their thesis supervisor, from MA Year II.
Proficiency in English. Applicants whose primary language is not English must demonstrate that their knowledge of English is sufficient to pursue graduate studies in their chosen field. Please refer to the  Graduate Admission page  for further information on the Language Proficiency requirements and exemptions.
Application process
Your completed application will include:
Application form and Fee
Curriculum Vitae (CV)
Three  Letters of Reference and  Academic Assessment forms  
Supplemental Letter of Recommendation form  for applicants to the Research and Clinical Training Option 
Statement of Purpose (1500 words) describing applicant's academic interest, primary area of concentration and research goals
Psychology Background Summary form
The Graduate Record Examination (GRE, aptitude and advanced) is recommended, but not required
Transcripts  for all post-secondary institutions attended
