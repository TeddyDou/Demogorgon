As an independent, non-profit, non-political organization with chapters on university campuses worldwide outside of mainland China, the objective of GCC is to:

Through events and educational seminars—and the latest Internet, telecommunications and multimedia tools—bring together GCC members for learning, networking and developing future professional opportunities.
Advance international trust and understanding through GCC member and alumni personal and professional relationships.
Promote high ethical standards for GCC members’ academic, professional and personal lives along with a commitment to make the world a better place through lifelong fellowship.
Have fun together.
Whether attending events, hosting delegations, writing research papers, or having a heated discussion over coffee, every interaction between our members connects China with the world, which helps our member to build a network of leaders who will shape the future.
