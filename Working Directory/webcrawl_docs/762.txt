A New Approach to Canadian and Conservative Politics
with Honourable Michael Chong,
Member of Parliament and Former Cabinet Member
November 24, 2017, 9 a.m. – 4:30 p.m.
A former candidate in the race for leadership of the Conservative party in 2017, and former Cabinet minister who stepped down from cabinet on the basis of a principled disagreement with the Harper government in 2006, Michael Chong is the Member of Parliament for Wellington-Halton Hills.
Chong has spent nearly 15 years in office pushing for reforms to strengthen Canadian democracy. Among his most notable achievements is the successful passage of a Private Member’s Bill, The Reform Act – a Bill that aims to rebalance the power between party leaders and MPs, thereby giving more voice to the citizens that elect them.
On November 24th, join the Honourable Michael Chong and explore the important questions pertaining to the future of Canadian and Conservative politics. How can we reform democracy in this country to make a better future for all Canadians? What types of institutional and policy reforms are necessary?
