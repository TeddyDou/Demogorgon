Polling and Politics: Opinions and Trends after 150 Years
with Dr. David Coletto,
CEO and a Founding Partner, Abacus Data
December 1, 2017, 9 a.m. – 4:30 p.m.
In this workshop, Dr. Coletto will take participants back through the evolution of public opinion research, pointing to the changes that have occurred over time in terms of methodology, access, and content. He will provide clear and real time examples of good and bad data collection, question wording, and the reporting of findings. Additionally, he will draw links to the ways in which faulty information can cause serious consequences for proper governance and public orientations toward the information that they receive.
Coletto will provide tools for participants so that they can incorporate his experience into their own work and their own consumption of polling and public opinion findings. He will also put forward suggestions for ways that we might pursue research in the future that would help to further improve the quality and integrity of our evidence, bettering the foundations on which decisions are made on a daily basis.
