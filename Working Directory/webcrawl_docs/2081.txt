Economics (BA)
Bachelor of Arts (BA)
Offered by:
Department of Economics , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why study Economics?
Interest rates, budget deficits, social services, taxes and sustainable economic growth: economic problems sit at the forefront of public debates. As an economist, your work informs business leaders and policy makers who must make decisions with lasting consequences.
You tackle real-world challenges. Your tools — economic theory and econometrics — rely on a sound knowledge of statistics, mathematics, as well as your keen analytical and communications abilities.
We provide a collegial environment to become an economist. You’ll receive tutorial support in key areas and personal attention from senior faculty. You may focus on any aspect of economics or acquire a broad background in the discipline.
As an honours or specialization student, you’ll benefit from a wide array of advanced applied economics courses, an active research department and a Co-operative education program.
Our grads compete effectively in the job market. Financial analysis, banking and the public sector all seek out economics graduates, while many other alumni enter graduate programs at leading universities.
