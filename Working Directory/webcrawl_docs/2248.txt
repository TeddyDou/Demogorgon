Explore Concordia page
As an independent documentary maker, trans-media artist, and professor who lived in Central and South America for over six years, I am committed to producing work that connects individuals across cultures. Over fifteen years of community media experience and a background in political economics, electronic media art, and Latin American studies, fuel my exploration of new media as art and as an educational tool.I am interested in new approaches to community collaborations and the documentary format and my work connects personal stories to larger social concerns. My new project, The Shore Line, is in interactive documentary looking at the tensions between unchecked development and climate change on coastal towns and cities around the world.

Going Public: The Art of Participatory Practice (2017)
The book is available through UCB Press ,
Going Public responds to the urgent need to expand current thinking on what it means to co-create and to actively involve the public in research activities. Drawing on conversations with over thirty practitioners across multiple cultures and disciplines, this book examines the ways in which oral historians, media producers, and theatre artists use art, stories, and participatory practices to engage creatively with their publics. The book offers insights into concerns related to voice, appropriation, privilege, and the ethics of participation.

This 35-minute documentary follows an inspiring Nicaraguan women’s rightsgroup, Puntos de Encuentro, as it works to end sexual violence at home, in bedand in the streets through a powerful blend of mainstream media and grassrootsorganizing.

Mapping Memories , 2009-2013
Mapping Memories is a participatory media project involving DIY cartography and refugee youth in coordination with the various partners including the Canadian Council for Refugees,  the Cote de Neige Youth Center , the YWCA which uses personal stories and a range of media tools (DIY cartography, video, sound walks, mapping, photography) to better understand the experiences of youth with refugee experience in Montreal. Our objective has been to produce creative work that will have an impact on policy, education, art and on the lives of the youth involved. We have produced a book in English and French, both of which are available for download as well as over twenty films and documentaries.
To launch the book, we organized a tour of 30 participating schools and universities.

In coordination with a national environmental organization, Food and Water Watch, the film toured around the Great Lakes from September 2008 to March 2009, and visited 30 cities. To build participation amongst youth, we launched an on-line audio remix competition of the theme song of the film, which was written by legendary blues singer, Joe L. Carter.
