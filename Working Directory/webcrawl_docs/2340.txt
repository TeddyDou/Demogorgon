Physical Chemistry of Organic Semiconductors
About the research
Dr. Ingo Salzmann is offering a funded PhD student position at Concordia University in Physics/Chemistry. The research project will target novel pathways for modifying the electronic structure of organic semiconductors, i.e. conjugated molecules and polymers, by electrical doping using novel doping agents and strategies. The primary objectives of this research project are increasing the doping efficiency, as well as fully understanding the underlying processes at work.
The student will fabricate nanostructures made of doped organic semiconductors via vacuum co-deposition and solution processing under an inert atmosphere. She/he will assess their optical and electronic properties using spectroscopic techniques, and characterize the underlying microstructure by scattering techniques. The experiments will be performed at the Concordia University Departments of Physics and Chemistry & Biochemistry, in the broader Montreal scientific environment, and at large-scale research facilities employing synchrotron radiation. The successful candidate will be embedded into broad international collaborations and disseminate her/his findings at conferences and in scientific publications.
 
Financial Commitment
The total financial support is estimated at $24,000 per year for 3 years with a possible extension by up to two additional years, if necessary. Awards to reduce the tuition levels of international students to those of a Quebec resident may be available.
For more information on this position and its scientific scope, please contact Ingo Salzmann ( Ingo.Salzmann@concordia.ca )
