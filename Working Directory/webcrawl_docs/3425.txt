Yarn Club
The Yarn Club is a fun way for people to support the FSA. Subscribers sign up for 3 months at a time to receive 100 grams of hand-dyed yarn in the mail each month.  The fun part is that you get a SURPRISE each month as to what kind of yarn you'll receive and what the colourway will be.  The sure thing is that the yarn will be a luscious natural fibre and the colourway will be delicious!
