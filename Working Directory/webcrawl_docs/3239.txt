Club Description: 
This Gaelic Games (GAA) Club is the first of its kind in a Canadian University. We call ourselves 'Na hÓglaigh Ollscoile - The Concordia Warriors'. 
At the moment we are in full recruitment in order to be able to get to the point where we can participate with local sports clubs in and around Montreal.
You can reach us at the email listed in the contact section, or you can email us at: register.concordiagaa@gmail.com
Certains d'entre nous parles français. Au plaisir de vous rencontrer.
'Óglaigh' is an old Gaelic term meaning 'Young Warriors'. It is referenced frequently in many of the myths and legends of a bygone Gaelic Ireland, a time when the legendary Fionn Mac Cumhaill and his band of Óglaigh would roam the Irish countryside. 
We value the sharing of both Canadian and Irish Culture in a sporting environment. All are welcome to join, as this is co-ed.
