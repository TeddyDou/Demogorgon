Last Modified: December __, 2015
Thanks for using Google Maps and Google Earth ("Google Maps/Google           Earth").
Google Maps/Google Earth allow you to view and use a variety of content, including map           and terrain data, imagery, business listings, traffic, reviews, and other related           information provided by Google, its licensors, and users (the "Content").
By accessing, downloading, or using Google Maps/Google Earth, you are agreeing to:
the Google Terms           of Service (the "Universal Terms");
these Maps/Google Earth additional terms (the "Maps/Earth Additional           Terms");
the Google Maps/Google Earth Legal Notices (the "Legal Notices"); and
the Google           Privacy Policy (the "Privacy Policy").
Please read each of these four documents carefully, starting with the Universal Terms.           The Universal Terms clarify, for example, your intellectual property           ownership rights in the content you upload , and your responsibilities when using           Google content or third-party content or when using Google           Maps/Google Earth while driving .
Collectively, we refer to the Universal Terms, the Maps/Earth Additional Terms, the Legal           Notices, and the Privacy Policy as the "Agreement". The Agreement is a           binding contract between you and Google regarding your use of Google Maps/Google Earth.
License. Subject to the Agreement's terms, Google grants you a               non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use Google Maps/Google Earth, including               features that allow you to:
view and annotate maps;
create KML files and map layers;
publicly display Content with proper attribution online, in video, and in print;                   and
do many other things described in the Using Google                   Maps, Google Earth, and Street View permissions page.
Prohibited Conduct. When using Google Maps/Google Earth, you may not               (or allow those acting on your behalf to):
redistribute or sell any part of Google Maps/Google Earth or create a new product                   or service based on Google Maps/Google Earth (unless you use the Google                   Maps/Google Earth APIs in accordance with their terms of service );
copy the Content (unless you are otherwise permitted to do so by the Using Google                   Maps, Google Earth, and Street View permissions page or applicable                   intellectual property law, including "fair use");
mass download or create bulk feeds of the Content (or let anyone else do so);
use Google Maps/Google Earth to create or augment any other mapping-related                   dataset (including a mapping or navigation dataset, business listings database,                   mailing list, or telemarketing list) for use in a service that is a substitute                   for, or a substantially similar service to, Google Maps/Google Earth;
use any part of Google Maps/Google Earth with other people's products or services                   for or in connection with real-time navigation or autonomous vehicle control,                   except through a specific Google-provided feature such as Android Auto or Send to                   Car;
reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code from Google Maps/Google                   Earth or any related software, except to the extent that this restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law;
remove, obscure, or alter any Google terms of service or any links to or notices                   of those terms, or any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary rights notices;                   or
do anything inappropriate, illegal, or in violation of others' rights (including                   their privacy, publicity, and intellectual property rights).
Actual Conditions; Assumption of Risk. When you use Google               Maps/Google Earth's map data, traffic, directions, and other Content, you may find               that actual conditions differ from the map results and Content, so exercise your               independent judgment and use Google Maps/Google Earth at your own risk. You’re               responsible at all times for your conduct and its consequences.
Your Content in Google Maps/Google Earth. Content you upload,               submit, store, send, or receive through Google Maps/Google Earth is subject to               Google’s Universal               Terms , including the license in the section entitled “Your Content in our               Services” . However, content that remains exclusively local to your device (such               as a locally-stored KML file) is not uploaded or submitted to Google, and is               therefore not subject to that license.
Government Users. If you are using our Services on behalf of a               government entity, the following terms apply:
Government Uses of Our Services. The Universal Terms section                   entitled “Business                   uses of our Services” is replaced in its entirety with the following:
“If you are using our Services on behalf of a government entity, that entity                   accepts these terms. Solely to the extent permitted by applicable law,                   regulation, or privileges and immunities, that entity will hold harmless and                   indemnify Google and its affiliates, officers, agents and employees from any                   claim, action or proceedings arising from or related to the use of the Services                   or violation of these terms, including any liability or expense arising from                   claims, losses, damages, judgements, litigation costs and legal fees.”
Governing Law.
For city or state government entities in the United States and European                       Union, the Universal Terms section regarding governing law and venue will not                       apply.
For United States federal government entities, the Universal Terms section                       regarding governing law and venue is replaced in its entirety with the                       following:
“This Agreement will be governed by and interpreted and enforced in                       accordance with the laws of the United States of America without reference to                       conflict of laws. Solely to the extent permitted by federal law: (A) the laws                       of the State of California (excluding California’s conflict of laws rules)                       will apply in the absence of applicable federal law; and (B) any dispute                       arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Services will be                       litigated exclusively in the federal courts of Santa Clara County,                       California, and the parties consent to personal jurisdiction in those                       courts.”
U.S. Government Restricted Rights. All access or use of Google                   Maps/Google Earth by or for the United States federal government is subject to                   the "U.S. Government Restricted Rights" section in the Legal Notices .
