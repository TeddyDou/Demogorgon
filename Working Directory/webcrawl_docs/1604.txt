Rights and responsibilities
The Office of Rights and Responsibilities works to promote respect on campus
Under the direction of the Director and Senior Advisor, Rights and Responsibilities (the “Advisor”), the Office of Rights and Responsibilities is mandated with administering the  Code of Rights and Responsibilities (PDF)  (the “Code”) and other related University policies. The Code sets standards of conduct for all University members (students, faculty, and staff).
Functions of the Office
Advise members who are experiencing a problem related to another member’s behaviour on campus
Assist members in addressing behavioural incidents and conflicts on campus
Responses may range from the use of informal dispute resolution methods to formal procedures for adjudicating complaints.
Remedies and sanctions attempt to restore harmony, collegiality, and cooperation.
Coordinate a procedure for identifying and managing behaviour that may pose a danger, and direct the University’s response to urgent cases
Promote through education and direct intervention the values of the Code as well as members’ rights and responsibilities
Make recommendations regarding situations which have the general effect of violating the rights of members

The Code of Rights and Responsibilities
The  Code of Rights and Responsibilities (PDF)  is intended to promote and protect the values of civility, equity, respect, non-discrimination and an appreciation of diversity as well as support members who have experienced or are experiencing conduct that violates these fundamental values. All members may reasonably expect to pursue their work, studies, and other activities related to University life in a safe and civil environment. As such, members are expected to refrain from violating the Code. The following offences are prohibited under the Code:
Abuse of computer privileges
Discrimination or communication of a discriminatory manner
Forgery or altering university documents
Harassment (psychological, sexual)
Hazing
Illegal offenses occurring in the University context
Misuse of the University name or logo
Obstruction or disruption of university activity
Possession of controlled substances or weapons
Theft or wilful damage of property
Threatening or violent conduct
Trespassing
(For a complete list of infractions and procedures, please consult the Code (PDF) ).
When to consult the Office
If you have a problem related to someone’s behaviour on campus and you are not sure how to deal with it, the Office can help you evaluate your options and make an informed choice of what steps to take.
Any University member may consult the Office
Consultations are confidential
The Advisor is impartial
The Office is independent in carrying out its duties
You do not have to file a complaint in order to get information or advice. In most cases informal resolution is both possible and desirable. If the situation warrants, the Advisor can guide you on how to proceed with a formal complaint. If it is necessary to file a formal complaint, the Code places great emphasis on fairness and natural justice.
You may also get advice for situations that may be happening off campus. Although the University cannot intervene in these situations, the Advisor will try to give you information, advice and support.
The full text of the Code can be found in the University calendars and online in English and in French .
