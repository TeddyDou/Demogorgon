Every 40 seconds a business falls victim to a ransomware attack. This billion-dollar industry is exploding, with attacks growing at a yearly rate of 350%. And by 2021, cybercrime will cost the world more than $6 trillion annually, according to Cybersecurity Ventures' 2016 Cybercrime Report. The epidemic is sweeping across the globe, and just when we think we might be gaining ground on our digital adversaries, a new, more powerful and complex attack is launched.
