Research Chair in Aging and Public Policy
Patrik Marier's Explore Concordia page
Dr. Patrik Marier obtained his Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Pittsburgh. He holds a Concordia University Research Chair in Aging and Public Policy and held a Canada Research Chair in Comparative Public Policy between 2005 and 2015.
Dr. Marier’s research focuses on the impact of aging populations on a number of public policy fields including pensions, healthcare, and labour policy across comparative cases. He is currently completing a book length manuscript on how Canadian provinces are preparing themselves to face the consequences and opportunities of an aging population. Dr. Marier has also written numerous publications on the politics of pension reforms in industrialized countries.
The CURC in Aging and Public Policy seeks to achieve three broad objectives. First, it aims to cement and enhance the development of collaborative research projects in public policy on issues related to aging. Second,the CURC in Aging and Public Policy will facilitate the continuation of and add depth to three major research projects focused on the autonomy of seniors, caregiving and pension policy. Finally, it will develop a speaker series devoted to policy issues surrounding aging and workshops in social gerontology.
Dr. Marier is the Scientific Director of CREGÉS , a university research centre housed at the Integrated Health and Social Services University Network for West-Central Montreal. It is a unique centre devoted to the field of social gerontology that encourages the development of research and innovating practices. The centre has more than 50 members, 33 of which are regular members. This includes university researchers from 11 different disciplines and six Quebec universities (Concordia, Laval, McGill, Université de Montréal, UQAM and UQTR).
Dr. Marier is also responsible for a research pillar in the FRQSC Team Aging, Social Exclusion, and Solidarities (VIES), a collaborator in the Ageing Communication Technologies partnership grant (ACT), a member of CIRANO, and a member of PERFORM.
