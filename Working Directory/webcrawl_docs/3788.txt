Calling all first year accounting students! The John Molson Accounting Society is excited to invite you to our annual First Year Event!
We know that the first few weeks of university can be exciting and nerve wracking especially when it comes to adapting to this new environment. We’ve been there, and we want to help! That’s why we have organized a fun night for you to meet us, mingle among yourselves all while enjoying a nice drink and great food. Did we mention that it’s all FREE!?

Can’t wait to see you all there!
