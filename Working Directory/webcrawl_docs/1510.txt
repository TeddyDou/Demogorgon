CPA Research Centre in Accountability
The CPA Research Centre in Accountability provides support and funding for primarily research, and teaching initiatives at the department of Accountancy at JMSB. The Centre aims to encourage fundamental and applied research on topics such as organizational performance, management control, sustainability accounting, information technology, and accounting education. It aims to produce articles for academic and professional journals, and strengthen ties between JMSB accounting professor, professional accountants, and managers. Those involved in the Centre are encouraged to disseminate their work broadly through media, through participation in workshops and conferences and through the publication of research results.
