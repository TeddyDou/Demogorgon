Visiting & exchange
An exciting feature of any university education is the contact students make with individuals from around the world. However, nothing compares to actually discovering the world for yourself!
Concordia students: go study abroad!
Concordia Student Exchange Program (CSEP)
As part of your JMSB degree program, you have the opportunity to gain valuable international experience by studying abroad.  Whether you want to learn a new language; be exposed to new markets, cultures and political systems; or simply explore an area of the world of interest you, the Concordia Student Exchange program provides you with many opportunities to add a global dimsension to your education!
Eligible students can spend one or two semesters on exchange at one of Concordia’s partner universities located in over 35 countries around the world.  While on exchange, you will continue to pay your normal Concordia tuition and can also apply for the Quebec Mobility Bursary or one of the many external awards for study abroad.
Eligibility Requirements
Have a minimum CGPA of 2.7 and maintain it until the departure date
Complete at least 24 credits before the departure date
Students must have completed the following courses at the JMSB prior to CSEP departure: COMM 205, COMM 210, COMM 215 and COMM 217
Complete all program deficiencies, including ESL courses and foundation courses for 120 and 108 programs, prior to application deadline

Visiting fee-paying option
JMSB students who wish to study at an institution that does not have an CSEP partnership with our school or who are not eligible for the CSEP, can apply to be a Visiting International Fee-Paying Outgoing Student at a particularinstitution. However, since this program is not a standardized Study Abroad Program, while away, student will not be recognized as full-time Concordia University student and therefore may not be eligible for government funding/loans while studying abroad. 
Students wishing to study abroad at non-partner institutions must complete the Student Request Form, a typed letter of intent for why you wish to study abroad, full-course listing and course descriptions for intended study and meet with Amanda Holt.  Students with cumulative GPAs 2.70 and above will be considered.
To book an appointment with Amanda Holt, please call 514-848-2424, ext. 2721.
