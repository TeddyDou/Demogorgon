Congratulations to Chantal Ringuet
Institute for Canadian Jewish Studies researcher nominated for co-editing book on Leonard Cohen
Posted on September 13, 2017
FAS extends congratulations to Chantal Ringuet and Gerard Rabinovitch, winners of a Canadian Jewish Literary Award in the category of Jewish Thought and Culture, for their book,  Les Revolutions de Leonard Cohen (Presses de l'Université du Québec).
Leonard Cohen, one of the greatest poets and songwriters of the contemporary era, has touched people throughout the world. But moreover, he was both a Montrealer and a Jew. Ringuet and Rabinovitch's collection of essays presents his work as the soul of the Jewish world deeply rooted in Quebec culture. 
Nine outstanding books have been chosen to receive the Canadian Jewish Literary Awards for 2017.  Now in its third year, the Canadian Jewish Literary Awards is a non-profit organization that annually recognizes and rewards the finest Canadian Jewish writing. 
Over 60 works on Jewish themes by Canadian writers were submitted for consideration. Winners have been declared in the following categories: fiction, memoir/biography, poetry, history, scholarship, Jewish thought and culture, Holocaust literature, Yiddish, and children and youth fiction.   
 “The depth and breadth of the submissions shows the vibrancy of the culture and the appeal of Jewish themes for fiction and non-fiction writers, both Jewish and non-Jewish,” says jury Co-chair, Edward Trapunski.  
The awards ceremony will be held on October 15.
