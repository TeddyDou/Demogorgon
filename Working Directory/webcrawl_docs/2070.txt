Biology (BSc)
Bachelor of Science (BSc)
Offered by:
Department of Biology , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why study Biology?
Get inspired by life. Immerse yourself in the study of life at all levels, from cell biology and the physiology of multicellular organisms to the interactions between organisms and their environment. Build a strong basis in the essentials, then choose the right topics for your chosen path.
Our Biology Department features teaching labs with state-of-the-art equipment that introduce you to the various techniques used in biology research. Small class sizes foster strong student-professor relationships. As a Biology student, you'll follow the Biology core curriculum and additional Biology courses based on your interests. Through labs, lectures and tutorials you will:
Study genes and how they control cellular and organismal function
Address fundamental and applied research problems
Study the chemical and cellular basis of living systems
Explore the evolution, biodiversity and ecology of organisms and their physiology and morphology
Receive extensive training in research methodology
Perform original research as an undergraduate  (honours and specialization students only)
Concordia’s hands-on approach provides a solid foundation for a career in the life sciences or environmental sciences, or paves the way for future graduate studies.
Program details
Program options & degree requirements
A Bachelor of Science degree takes a minimum of three or four years (90 – 120 credits) of full-time study,  depending on your academic background .
Options:
Honours in Biology (72 credits)
Specialization in Biology (60 credits)
Students planning a career or graduate studies in the biological sciences are encouraged to follow an Honours or Specialization program. The Honours programs require a strong academic performance and a two-term undergraduate research project and thesis as a 6-credit course (BIOL 490).
 
Major in Biology (45 credits)
Minor in Biology (24 credits)
The Major and Minor programs have fewer required credits in the biology curriculum than the Honours and Specialization programs and allow students to take more courses in other disciplines to fulfill the 90 credit requirement for a BSc degree. The Major includes all courses that are required for admission to most medical degree programs.

Curriculum requirements
Required Biology credits are as follows:
Honours in Biology (72 credits)
Specialization in Biology (60 credits)
Major in Biology (45 credits)
Minor in Biology (24 credits)
Each option also has specific required and optional courses. See the curriculum for each option .
Undergraduate research
Undergraduate students in the Department of Biology have excellent opportunities to carry out individualized, original research projects in the laboratory of an externally-funded research group under the supervision of a faculty member.

Co-op program
The Co-op program gives you the chance to complete paid work terms that last 12 to 16 weeks. As a Co-op student, you will work for firms where you may:
characterize the effects of drug candidates in cells and/or animals
undertake bacterial or blood smear preparations and staining
work on gene cloning and molecular diagnostics
act as a field assistant, with species identification, measurement and counting
Learn more about our Co-op program.
After your degree
Biology undergraduates have the foundation to pursue graduate studies or medicine. Biology alumni have established careers in a variety of science fields that include:
Medicine
Pharmacology
Environmental management
Science education
The Specialization and Honours programs prepare students for a career in the biological sciences, including graduate studies. The Major program can be combined with a degree in another department based on interest or to target niche careers that combine multiple expertise. For example, a student interested in a career in management of a biotechnology company or governmental regulatory agency might combine a Major in Biology with a major program in business or communications.
