Welcome to Space Concordia's Special Projects Division!
About the Special Projects Division
Space Concordia’s Special Projects Division is a platform for students to develop independent space projects that are too small or too new to be considered a division on its own. Through this division, we wish to promote new innovative ideas, may it be for internal RnD, University competitions, capstone projects or genuine curiosity.
