Program design
Our focus is on the human environment, specifically the ongoing radical transformation of the earth by human action. The program is designed to:
sustain a critical awareness of the complexity and interconnectedness within and between cultural and natural systems
foster an understanding of the causes and consequences of environmental change
identify effective practices and policies for environmental management
develop student skills in critical thinking and writing
provide students with important technical skills, such as qualitative and quantitative research methods and Geographic Information Systems.
For all Geography BA programs there is a common 12 credit core in the first year and a common 12 credit core in the second year. The program is made up of courses in human geography, physical geography and techniques. In the first year there is one introductory course in each area followed by a course which integrates all three. At the second year, students take courses in all three areas; while in the final year all courses integrate both physical and human geography.
