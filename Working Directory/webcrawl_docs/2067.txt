Christian Spirituality (Cert)
Certificate (Cert)
Offered by:
Department of Theological Studies , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why choose the Certificate in Christian Spirituality?
Allow yourself to ask the big questions about the meaning of life and look at the answers through the lens of your own experience of the world. Immerse yourself in the rich traditions of Christian spirituality like Celtic Christianity and Ignatian Spirituality. Explore the ways in which a person’s worldview, centred in a culturally specific understanding of reality, affects their sense of spirituality. Develop the practical skills to become a valuable companion to others in their spiritual journey by completing a practicum.
While grounded in the Christian faith, the certificate program allows room for people of all backgrounds to look at how spirituality is understood and expressed today.
The Certificate in Christian Spirituality is an excellent foundation for those interested in working towards a Bachelor’s degree in Theological Studies.
Program options
Certificate in Christian Spirituality (30 credits)
