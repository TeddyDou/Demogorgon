Academia.edu Profile
I am an urban, social, and cultural geographer. Most of my work examines how people and spaces are understood and managed in modern cities. I am interested in how new ways of understanding people and spaces come into being; how these understandings are influenced by prevailing social hierarchies (e.g., those related to race, class, and gender); and how, as a result, these understandings improve the lives of some people and worsen those of others. The work, in other words, is to trace how dominant forms of knowledge are implicated in the creation of various social injustices and how they marginalize other forms of knowledge that, in contrast, might make possible a more livable and liberatory society.
In more practical terms, this research has involved a sustained examination of modern urban planning, urban development, urban policing/security, and social movements in North American (and particularly Canadian) cities. My forthcoming book, Displacing Blackness: Planning, Power, and Race in Twentieth Century Halifax, carries these concerns through more than a century of history in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The book seeks to draw connections between urban history/geography and Black Studies, showing how modern conceptions of "the human" have been shaped by anti-blackness (as Black scholars, since Fanon, have frequently argued) and how planning's efforts to improve human life have, consequently, been racialized in both their conception and effects. My more recent research has focused on Montréal, and a series of issues related to housing, tenants' rights, urban security, and policing.
I am interested in supervising critically oriented masters and PhD research on the city of Montréal, especially research concerned with policing and housing in the post-1970s period.
