Club Description: 
The main purpose of this debate club is to enrich students’ debate style options. Unlike most countries which adopt a parliamentary debating style, Chinese debating adopts Singapore’s debating style, which is focused more on refuting and free debating. Moreover, the club is aimed at providing more opportunities for students to develop critical thinking and to learn how to speak effectively. It will also be a platform for students who want to learn about the Chinese debate rules and culture.
