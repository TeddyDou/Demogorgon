Psychology (BA, BSc)
Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Science (BSc)
Offered by:
Department of Psychology , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why study Psychology?
Modern scientific psychology studies brain processes and behaviour — both human and animal — under various conditions. Psychologists study the relationships between the brain and behaviour: the processes that determine how we learn to speak, create and keep memories, or respond to stress. When you study psychology, you examine the internal and external factors that influence development, cognition, perception and motivation.
All Psychology students follow a core psychology curriculum. Regardless of your program you’ll also:
Receive fundamental training in statistics and research methods
Learn the basic principles of behavioural neurobiology
Study the history of psychology
A Psychology degree opens many doors; specialization or honours students may choose to work as a psychologist, therapist, or pursue graduate studies or medical research. Students majoring in Psychology can complement their studies in other fields such as business, communications or education.
Program details
