Dear Students,
I would like  to extend a very warm welcome to you all – both new and returning students ― to  the Concordia Library. Concordia Library consists of the Webster and Vanier libraries  and the Grey Nuns reading room. 
The Library is an important partner in your academic success.  We have a team of dedicated librarians and  staff ready to assist you with a variety of services, such as  subject-specific research across our comprehensive print and digital  collections, the use of our interlibrary loans services, or simply borrowing a  laptop or tablet.  Please feel free to  ask. We are here to assist you!
During the last academic year (2016-17), our Teaching & Learning Librarian  redesigned and launched a set of 5 modular library workshops designed specifically for first-year students.  In addition to introducing you to our many  services, these workshops will explain how to develop effective research  questions, locate articles and books and how to best take notes when  researching for a term paper. These workshops can be taken together, or  separately. For more information:   http://library.concordia.ca/help/workshops/index.php .
We are eagerly  looking forward to the opening of part of the third floor and the fourth floor  on September 12. This means that new and returning students will be able to enjoy  the full benefits of a renovated Webster  Library.  We plan to celebrate the completion  of the Webster Transformation in style in January 2018.  Stay tuned, you’ll be invited!
Finally, I want  to express my appreciation and gratitude to the Library Services Fund  Committee (LSFC) and its student representatives for their ongoing  support. Last year, the LSFC helped fund, among other things, 24-hour access to the Vanier Library  and Webster Library (during the academic year), the laptop and tablet loan program and the acquisition of textbooks and other course materials for both the Webster  and Vanier Library reserve rooms.
As  always, I welcome your thoughts on how Concordia Library can continue to  address and best serve your academic needs.  Please do not hesitate to  contact me at guylaine.beaudry@concordia.ca .
I wish you  a most productive fall 2017 term!
Sincerely,
Guylaine Beaudry, PhD
