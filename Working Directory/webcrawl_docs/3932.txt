Beyond the solutions, the numbers, and the final results, lies the heart of the competition: the relationships built, the memories shared, and above all, the JMUCC experience. The Spirit Award is awarded annually to the team who exceptionally enhanced not only their own experience, but the experience of their fellow delegates as well. The winning team will be chosen as a result of their participation and enthusiasm at JMUCC events, their positive and uplifting attitude throughout the week of the competition, and most of all, their respect for their peers, volunteers, and the organizing committee.
The Hospitality Award is awarded annually to the volunteer who has gone above and beyond their mandate, and enhanced the JMUCC experience of their fellow peers, as well as that of the delegates. The recipient of the award will be chosen as a result of their participation and enthusiasm at JMUCC events, their positive and uplifting attitude throughout the week of the competition, and most of all, their utmost respect and helpfulness towards their peers, delegates, and the organizing committee.
