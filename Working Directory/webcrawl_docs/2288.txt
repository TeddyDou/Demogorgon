Matt Soar's Explore Concordia page
I am an intermedia artist , chiefly a filmmaker and writer, with a scholarly background in design, media and cultural studies. My research-creation activities usually lie at the juncture of residual and emergent media forms. My primary teaching area is Intermedia; I have also taught courses on cultural production and media ethnography, and signs and public lettering. My graduate degrees in Communication are from Simon Fraser University and the University of Massachusetts Amherst.
Research-Creation
1. SIGNS AND PUBLIC LETTERING: I am the director and co-founder of the Montreal Signs Project . My current FQRSC Appui à la recherche-création grant, titled Les enseignes de Montréal: Culture, technologie, patrimoine, is in three parts: Les Enseignistes de Montréal, a web doc about the histories of signmaking in Montreal (co-director Dayna McLeod; premiered September 2017 at ATypI ), a gallery installation on human migration and land rights called YMX , and an expansion of the current permanent exhibition of the Montréal Signs Project.  2. LOST LEADERS: An ongoing  research-creation project  on the history of film leader standards in the US and Canada (see image below). 3. DATABASE STORYTELLING: From 2012 to 2015 I was Principal Investigator on a SSHRC Research/Creation in the Fine Arts grant titled Adventures in Research-Creation . My teammate was Dr. Monika Kin Gagnon, and our collaborators were Florian Thalhofer , Phil Hoffman , and Midi Onodera . Our event Database | Narrative | Archive , an international symposium on digital nonlinear storytelling, was held at Concordia in May 2011; Dr Gagnon and I subsequently co-edited the DNA Anthology , a post-symposium collection of seven nonlinear, interactive essays built using Scalar . From 2008 to 2016 I was codirector of development for the Korsakow System . In May 2015, Phil Hoffman launched his Korsakow film Racing Home , an extended, lyrical exercise in 'posthumous cinema'.

Workshops, Shows, Panels, Residencies
In September 2017 I had the privilege of presenting the premiere of my web documentary Les Enseignistes de Montréal (co-director Dayna McLeod) and an overview of my Lost Leaders project at the annual  ATypI  conference. In June 2017 I co-presented a paper titled Migration, Media Archaeology, and the Montréal-Mirabel International Airport at Poetics & Politics of Documentary 3 (University of Sussex, England) with outstanding grad student Danica Evering. In Winter 2017 I co-curated YMX: Migration, Land, and Loss after Mirabel, a show created in collaboration with artist Cheryl Sim, and grads Danica Evering and Treva Pullen, featuring two Solari split-flap passenger information displays . YMX ran for two weeks in the CJ Media Gallery in late January and a further two weeks in early March at Gallery POPOP in the Belgo Building. From 2008 to 2016 I was co-developer of the Korsakow System , a software application for nonlinear storytelling. I have taught dozens of Korsakow workshops, eg Concordia, UdM, Montreal Encuentro, NYU, RMIT, USC, and the Universities of Bologna, Colorado, and Western Sydney. In May 2016 I was part of a 'critical karaoke' panel at the Canadian Communication Association annual conference in Calgary, with a very short presentation titled 'Flight YMX: Migration, Remediation, and Montreal-Mirabel International Airport'. In April 2016 I premiered a 'handwritten' cameraless animation at the 10th Orphan Film Symposium in Culpeper, VA, and gave a short talk as part of the McCord Museum's Échanges Urbains lecture series. In May 2015 I gave a talk on Lost Leaders at Poetics & Politics of Documentary 2 (UCSC). In May 2014 I was part of a research-creation panel at the International Communication Association’s annual conference in Seattle. In October 2014 I had a two-week residency at the Banff Centre, which led to this short artist's profile  (note to self: don't talk publicly about your work until you fully understand your object of study). In March 2014 I had a brief artist’s residency at the Media Archaeology Lab at UC Boulder. During the same trip I gave an artist’s talk at Counterpath in Denver about Lost Leaders  (thanks to Dr. Mél Hogan for making the introductions). In March 2014 I presented on Lost Leaders at the ninth Orphan Film Symposium , in Amsterdam.
