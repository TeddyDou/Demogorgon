MEDIA ARCHAEOLOGY
How can dissecting obsolete media inform contemporary media culture?
May 23â€“27, 2017
Through a mix of writing, thinking, discussing, and hands-on encounters with obsolete and forgotten apparatuses, participants are asked to scrutinize our rapidly-evolving media culture. 
Benefiting from the rich collection of the Concordia  Residual Media Depot , students demystify hardware modification, software hacking and digital forensics, to develop a critical and theoretical relationship with material media technologies.
Knowledge production in this area is seen as a collaborative process where participants from varying disciplines bring different approaches to the table.
