Published on Oct 27, 2017
On April 27, 2017 PhD and MA students in Economics showcased their research projects in a stimulating poster session. It was an opportunity to discuss and exchange research ideas, discover new topics, and network with graduate students, faculty, alumni, prospective students, and others from the broader Concordia community. The poster session was followed by a reception, during which Dr. Paula Wood-Adams, Dean of Graduate Studies, presented awards to the best PhD and MA posters based on the votes of participants.
This event was co-organized by the Department of Economics and the Economics Graduate Students Association (EGSA), and sponsored by the School of Graduate Studies and CIRANO.
