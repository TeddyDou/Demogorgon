Human Relations (BA)
Bachelor of Arts (BA)
Offered by:
Department of Applied Human Sciences , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why study Human Relations?
Train the leaders of the future. Help people fulfill their potential. When you study human relations, your passion for people shapes you into an agent for social change. Expertise in human relationships in the community and the workplace sets you on a path towards the helping professions. Whether you want to build strong teams in the corporate world or get organized at a grassroots level, our Human Relations program gives you the tools to become a next-generation leader.
In a curriculum that straddles the classroom and the outside community, you will hone your leadership and teamwork skills. You’ll also:
Study the dynamics of people in groups and one-on-one interactions
Practise techniques of intervention and facilitation that resolve conflicts
Learn to coordinate and execute special events and programs for the community-at-large
Perform in-the-field research
Concordia’s hands-on approach provides a solid foundation for future graduate studies in such fields as human resource development and training, organization or community development, social work, and public or business administration. Students graduate with transferable skills that bring about empowerment, self-management and effective teamwork in a rapidly changing workplace.
Program Details
Degree options
A Bachelor of Arts degree takes a minimum of three or four years (90 – 120 credits) of full-time study, depending on your academic background .
Program options:
Specialization in Human Relations (60 credits)
The Specialization is intended to develop a high level of skill and knowledge in small group leadership and its applications in practical settings. The Specialization includes a research component and an internship in the final year, culminating and focusing on the student's emphasis of study.
Major in Human Relations (42 credits)
The Major is intended to develop human relations skills and a good grounding in small group leadership. The Major includes a fieldwork component in the final year, which gives the students an opportunity to apply the skills, and knowledge derived from the classroom. The Major gives the students the flexibility to take a variety of elective courses in other areas in addition to Applied Human Sciences, or for those with specific needs or interests, to select a double Major or Minor in another department to fulfill their degree requirements.
Minor in Human Relations (30 credits)
This program gives the student an opportunity to obtain knowledge and practice in group dynamics, group leadership, interpersonal relations and communications, design skills and simulated class practice in facilitation. The Minor is designed to provide a basic understanding of group and/or teamwork which is an increasingly important aspect in today's work environment.
