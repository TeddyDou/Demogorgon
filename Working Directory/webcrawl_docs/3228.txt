Club Description: 
As Canada's original literacy organization, Frontier College has been recruiting dedicated volunteers to work with Canadian children, youth and adults from all over Canada since 1899. We believe literacy is a right. We work with volunteers and community partners to give people the skills and confidence they need to reach their potential and contribute to society.We will achieve our mission for literacy while incorporating our values through the following actions:
Volunteer mobilization
Youth leadership development
Community capacity building
Frontier College at Concordia University has been active since 1992. We focus our activities in the neighbourhoods around both campuses, including Little Burgundy, Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, downtown and Pointe Saint-Charles. Activities generally take place at a community partner site (eg: women's shelters, housing projects, youth organizations and Aboriginal Organizations) and volunteers are trained to participate in one of the following activities: Reading Circles, Homework Clubs and one-on-one adult tutoring. for more information, visit our national website: www.frontiercollege.ca
