Theological Studies (MA)
Master of Arts (MA)
Offered by:
Department of Theological Studies , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why pursue a Master’s in Theological Studies?
From its modest beginnings in the mid-1st century to its rise as the world’s biggest religion, Christianity’s role within society is in constant evolution. With the Church now operating in a pluralistic society, we need academic researchers more than ever to respectfully approach the history of theology while maintaining an eye on the future.
The MA in Theological Studies offers you the chance to explore the relationships between varieties of religious experience and human society. Positioning itself in the humanities, our program provides an interdisciplinary environment for advanced research by using tools and methodologies present in other disciplines such as philosophy, history and languages.
You’ll join a vibrant community of researchers and faculty members who will encourage you to go beyond established disciplinary boundaries as you examine the function of theology and faith in a secular era.
Our diverse student body is composed of individuals with a variety of religious backgrounds, or no religious backgrounds at all, as well as people who have questions about faith and spirituality. Our alumni are well-placed to continue in the field by pursuing doctoral studies or working in various sectors of the society.
