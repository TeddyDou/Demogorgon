THE LABLIFE PROJECT
The LabLife Project brings interdisciplinarity to life by promoting our rich laboratory culture which emphasizes hands-on experience and teamwork. We are completing an inventory of all labs and activities â€“ this data will allow us to create interdisciplinary learning hubs, or living labs, for the community.
This project features a 3-pronged approach:
Map all lab activities and identify their impact within and across each academic sector
Create co-labs that link our labs with other laboratories both nationally and internationally
Invite international Grad students for a  LabLife Summer Field School
