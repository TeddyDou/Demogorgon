Working in Canada
Information Session for International Students
December 1, 2017, 10 a.m. – 11:30 a.m.

We will look at:
The proper documentation needed authorizing you to work on and off campus
What resources are available to help you find work
Obtaining your Social Insurance Number
Filing taxes
The possibility of becoming a permanent resident of Canada
This is a great opportunity to familiarize yourself with the Immigration Canada’s rules and regulations and have all your questions answered. We look forward to seeing you.
