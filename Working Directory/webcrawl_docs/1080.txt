Graduate Diploma in Chartered Professional Accountancy (CPA)
An innovative CPA program built on a tradition of academic excellence and designed to meet the needs of the next generation of accounting professionals.
JMSB enjoys a long and proud tradition of excellence in graduate accounting education. Our dedicated instructors have years of audit, consulting and accounting experience. Our CPA program builds on the consistently successful results of our former CA and Executive CMA programs, and our students achieved excellent first-time writer pass rates for the Fall 2016 Common Final Examination (CFE); several made the CFE National Honour Roll.
The graduate diploma accommodates students with career objectives both within, and outside of, public accountancy, which is determined by their choice of elective courses .
Why the John Molson CPA Program?
Transfer CPA program credits toward the world-renowned John Molson MBA*
Dedicated instructors with years of audit, consulting and accounting experience
Choice of elective courses for different career objectives
3 admissions per year (Fall, Winter and Summer)
Evening courses allow you to keep working and continue gaining experience during the day
* Subject to some conditions
Chartered Professional Accountancy Designation
The Chartered Professional Accountancy (CPA) Order was created in May 2012 following the unification of the accounting profession in Quebec. It results from a merger of the Ordre des comptables agréés (CA), the Ordre des comptables généraux accrédités (CGA) and the Ordre des comptables en management accrédités (CMA). The Order thus represents all the areas of expertise of the profession—assurance, financial accounting, management and management accounting, finances and taxation —at the service of enterprises, organizations and the public.
The CPA Order comprises over 36,000 members and 7,000 future CPAs. By combining its distinctive forces under a single order, the Quebec accounting profession strengthens its position both nationally and internationally.
Learn more about becoming a Chartered Professional Accountant on the  Order's website .
