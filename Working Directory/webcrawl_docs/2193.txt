Current research
The causes of the baby-boom in Quebec: A comparative approach. This project combines newly available census data with survey data and vital statistics to explore the not so well-known causes of the baby-boom and, more specifically, the specific contribution of various groups to the baby-boom. The project has a strong comparative component directed both towards other Canadian provinces and towards other countries that have also experienced a baby-boom during the 1940s and 1950s. Funded by SSHRC, the project is conducted with Benoît Laplante (INRS-UCS).
