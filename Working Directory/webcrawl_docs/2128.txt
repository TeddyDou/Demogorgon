Therapeutic Recreation (BA)
Bachelor of Arts (BA)
Offered by:
Department of Applied Human Sciences , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why study Therapeutic Recreation?
When you study Therapeutic Recreation, your passion for people shapes you into an agent for change. As a therapeutic recreation specialist, you assess individual leisure needs in order to design specialized programs for individuals with physical, social, intellectual, or emotional disabilities. You may work alongside a team of occupational and physical therapists and social workers to maintain or improve a client’s quality of life and enhance his or her independence.
The curriculum bridges the classroom and the outside community, giving you real-life experiences that hone your leadership and teamwork skills. You’ll also:
Understand individual and societal influences on leisure behaviour in the practice of therapeutic recreation and administration
Learn to assess individual and community needs in order to develop, coordinate and implement special events and programs for diverse populations
Engage in fieldwork with community organizations to evaluate the success of therapeutic recreation programs
Concordia’s hands-on approach provides a solid foundation for future graduate studies in such fields as recreation and leisure studies, organization or community development or public or business administration. Students graduate with practical skills that let them flourish in the health-care services sector.
