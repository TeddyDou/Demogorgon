RESEARCH ASSISTANTSHIP
IN PHILOSOPHY
Reasoning – Its Nature and Its Rules
About the research
Supervisor: Dr. Ulf Hlobil, Assistant Professor of Philosophy
The ability to reason, to make inferences, is crucial to rationality. But how do inferences differ from mere associations of thoughts? After all, not every case of some beliefs causing another belief is an inference. What more is required? There currently is a wave of interest in these questions, after philosophers have realized that inference is “surprisingly understudied by philosophers” (Paul Boghossian). The goal of this project is to fill this lacuna by providing a novel and compelling account of reasoning. This overarching goal has four aspects: (i) In what sense, if any, are we active in our reasoning? (ii) Can we give a reductive account of reasoning? (iii) What are the different kinds of reasoning and what do they have in common? (iv) What are the norms that govern reasoning and why?
The method of the project is to develop criteria of adequacy that every good theory of reasoning must meet. In a second step, we will then work out an account of reasoning that meets all these criteria of adequacy. The central idea of the new theory is that inferences must be analyzed into an argument (which is a structured collection of contents) and a force, in analogy to Gottlob Frege’s analysis of judgment. We will draw on Frege’s force/content distinction and on the Aristotelian-Thomistic idea of the form of a mental act.
The research project brings together strands from different areas of philosophy: logic, epistemology, practical rationality, philosophy of mind, and moral psychology. Analyzing and evaluating various recent proposals regarding the nature of reasoning will be a core aspect of the research.
Financial commitment
The Research Assistantship is valued at approx. $4,000 CAD over one academic year (prior to taxes). The position may be extended for a second academic year.
Selected candidates will also be considered for merit-based entrance awards, bursaries and tuition remissions.
