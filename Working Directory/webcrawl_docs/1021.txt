Centre for Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence
Pattern recognition and machine intelligence (PARMI) has been a very active field in the past 20 years, particularly in the application area. PARMI techniques have been used to recognize characters, time-varying signals, voice, satellite pictures, objects, fingerprints, and weather patterns, in many scientific, business, and military applications.

Concordia Institute for Water, Energy and Sustainable Systems
The Concordia Institute for Water, Energy and Sustainable Systems (CIWESS) trains students to be at the forefront of sustainable development practices. It promotes research into new systems, technologies and solutions for water, energy and resource conservation. While the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science is the home base of the Institute, under Director Catherine Mulligan, the Institute's activities will eventually include all of Concordia's four faculties and will also provide opportunities for collaborations with industry and communities.
