ASFA Presents: Midnight Breakfast
What is Midnight Breakfast?
Midnight Breakfast provides students with free snacks and coffee during finals. It is a two-day event that happens twice a year during the Fall and Winter semesters. The event usually goes on from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. (or until supplies last!) at the Webster Library Atrium in the downtown campus and Vanier Library Atrium in the Loyola campus.
