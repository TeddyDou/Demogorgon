Learn Mandarin Chinese & Spice up your...
0
Hi guys!!! If you've clicked this ad, that means you must be very interested in learning Mandarin!!!
Yasss! As you all know, Mandarin has become one of the most popular second language people choose to learn. WHY? Because, it's spoken by the largest amount of people around the world, plus it is valuable to be able to explore  worldwide opportunities. Whether it be in  local Chinese companies or in non-Chinese companies who want to do business in China, mandarin is an essential asset. 
I'm an international student who was born and raised in China. During my 3-year experience in Montreal, I've taught Mandarinto my friends from various backgrounds from: Korea, Canada, Australia, America, Kenya, Norway and Morocco etc. 
It is fun experience, both for my friends and myself. I teach it through casual or professional conversation, which can give you chance to use and practicewhat you've learned, right after every class.
The price is very affodable and it will depend on your level. I will provide you with appropriate learning materials, whether you only know how to say "Nihao", or you need a partner to practice your business presentation with.
 
I will give you a free 45-minute trail class anytime you want, so then you can decide if you want to spend 2 hours every week with me :))))
If you want to contact me, text me by 514-573-9288, or email me at danxihuang816@gmail.com
Life is short, learn a valuable language and expand your horizon!
Look forward to meeting you sometime in the future!
