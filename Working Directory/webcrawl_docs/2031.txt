Assistant Professor
Department of Applied Human Sciences
Prof. Tagny Duff
Tagny Duff, Assistant Professor in the Department of Communication Studies, has an extensive background in media art production and exhibition practice, with a focus on video, performance, net art and bio art. She joins the Concordia faculty after living abroad for two years while conducting PhD field research and an artist residency at SymbioticA, the Centre of Excellence in Biological Arts in the School of Anatomy and Human Biology at the University of Western Australia.
Duff is the recipient of various awards including the Canada Council for the Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council Doctoral Fellowship and FQRSC doctoral fellowship for her PhD dissertation "Moist Media Documents: Viral contagion from performance to documentation".
Duff's current research looks at the intersection of media and visual culture, with a specific interest in the conceptual, metaphoric and applied use of digital and biological viruses within net culture and laboratory research. By working hands-on with biotechnology and scientific techniques, Duff is interested in demystifying and making public, the use, creation and cultural perceptions of the viral.
The production of art works for various public audiences is both a process and extension of her research. "The Living Viral Tattoos," a series of sculptures made from human ex-plant tissue and synthetic retroviruses explores and critiques how biotechnology both marks and regenerates cellular bodies. The work was selected for the International Symposium of Electronic Art exhibition (2009) and will be featured in the solo exhibition "Viral Memorabilia", FoFA Gallery, Concordia Gallery (2011). The video documentation of this project was featured in the Moscow Biennial (2009), The Moscow Film Festival (2008), Kaliningrad National Centre for Contemporary Art (2008).
Duff has written and published on the areas of performance and media. Articles in books include "FFWD, RRWD and PLAY, Performance, video and reflections on Feminism in Vancouver, 1973-1983" published in Caught in the Act: Performance Art by Canadian Women, edited by Tanya Mars and Johanna Householder, and "Telepresence" in SON: Sound in Contemporary Canadian Art, edited by Nicole Gingras. "Going Viral: Performance and documentation in the science laboratory" forthcoming in the peer reviewed journal Performance Research.
Fluxmedia, founded by Duff, is a research/creation network exploring the intersections of art, science and technology. A series of presentations featuring bioartists in conversation with Concordia researchers is scheduled in March, and is funded through a Concordia Aid for Research Related Events award.
