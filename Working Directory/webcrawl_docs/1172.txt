Faculty overview
More than 3,700 students are enrolled in 60 undergraduate and graduate programs in an environment that reflects the openness and diversity of contemporary culture. Committed to integrating new technologies, traditional media and historical fine arts practices,  faculty members  are artists, scholars and researchers who are active on the international and national stage and equally engaged in their communities.
The Faculty has  nine departments  and four research centres  in the heart of Montreal, surrounded by museums, galleries, cinemas, theatres and concert halls.
Among the excellent  facilities  available to students and faculty members is the Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Complex, opened in 2005 and home of several of the university's landmark research labs for new media and technologies.
Each year, our graduates join a large, active and thriving group of over 15,900  alumni  who work, teach and create around the world. Visit our  news and events page  for news about faculty, alumni and students and their contribution to our cultural landscape.
Be sure to  visit our Fine Arts playlist on YouTube  to see our students in action.
Concordia’s Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (EV) is a focal point for the university’s downtown campus, providing space for first-rate  facilities  and equipment for traditional media and digital technologies. The building’s massive 6,000 sq. ft. mural was designed by former Concordia student Nicolas Baier in association with Cabinet Braun-Braën.
