International fee exemptions
International students eligible for Quebec tuition rates
Quebec's Ministère de l’Éducation et de l’Enseignement supérieur (MEES) has several categories of international students who are exempt from paying international differential tuition fees.
Deadline to apply
The last day of classes in each term is the deadline for you to requesting an exemption and submitting all supporting documents. Requests that are incomplete at the end of the term or are submitted after the term may not be processed for that term. There is no retroactivity.
Where to submit Documents
Documentation may be submitted to the Birks Student Service Centre at LB-185 . Please contact Quebec.residency@concordia.ca to ensure that your documents have been received.
Who can claim exemptions
The following international students may be exempt from international differential tuition fees:
 
Diplomats, consular personnel, accredited representatives or civil servants of a foreign country, the United Nations or one of its organizations, an intergovernmental organization to which Canada belongs, and any member of the staff of the above-listed persons working in Canada in an official capacity and who have obtained an attestation issued by  "le Protocole"  (Gouvernement du Québec) . 
This attestation is valid for one academic year and must be renewed each year the student attends university;
Required Document: Original letter from the Quebec Protocole Office naming the student and stating the year and session of the exemption.
 
The spouse and unmarried children of the above-listed persons;
Required Document: Original letter from the Quebec Protocole Office naming the student and stating the year and session of the exemption.
 
International students whose spouse or parents hold work permits valid for working in Quebec with these conditions:
Case Type must be one of these categories 07, 08, 20, 22, 23, 26, 52 or 53;
the place of employment must be stated and must be in Quebec;
the employer must be named.
For further details and verification, please contact the Office of the Registrar, Room, LB 700,
514-848-2424 ext. 2650 or 3271
Required Documents:
The spouse or parents work permit with the above characteristics;
proof of kinship with the spouse (marriage certificate) or parent (long form birth certificate)
 
Students who are registered at a university and who have come to Quebec as an exchange student, or as a student participating in a program of cooperation agreed to by the Government of Quebec and which exempts the participants from paying differential fees;
Required Documents: None. Concordia will receive notification directly from the Government of Quebec.
International students who are French citizens (accord France-Québec) and hold a valid French passport;
The Quebec government has reached an agreement  with the government of France regarding French citizens who study in Quebec.
French students studying in an undergraduate program leading to an Undergraduate Certificate or Degree will be charged the same tuition as Canadian students from outside Quebec. Our tuition fee calculator  can provide you with an estimate of what to expect. Under Step 1, choose “Canadian, non-Quebec resident” for the most accurate estimate.
French students studying in a graduate program leading to a Graduate Certificate, Graduate Diploma, Masters or PhD will be charged the same tuition as Quebec residents.
Required Document: Valid French passport (pages with photo, names and expiration date) or Valid French nationality card (both sides).
Here is an outline of how these regulations affects students who are French citizens:

Notes:
Students who studied at Concordia in Winter 2015 and continue their studies in the same Bachelors program will continue to pay tuition at the Quebec rate, in accordance with the pre-2015 France-Quebec agreement. However if they change to a different Bachelors program then they will pay tuition at the Canadian rate.
 
Students who are new to Concordia but studied at another Quebec university in the same discipline*1 in Winter 2015 will continue to pay tuition at the Quebec rate, in accordance with the pre-2015 France-Quebec agreement. However if they change to a different Bachelors program then they will pay tuition at the Canadian rate.
*1 The term “discipline” refers to the field of study. — For example, if a French student in a BA Major History in Winter 2015 switches to a BA Honours History in Fall 2015, this student has remained in the same discipline and will continue to pay the Quebec tuition rate until they complete the program. If a French student in a BA Major History in Winter 2015 switches to a BA Major Mathematics in Fall 2015, this student has NOT remained in the same discipline and will pay the Canadian tuition rate until they complete the program.
Students admitted to a Quebec university and whose country has a fee remission agreement with the Quebec Government. Please consult the following Ministry PDF document for a list of eligible countries and international organizations.  Liste des pays, incluant une organisation internationale, à qui le gouvernement du Québec accorde des exemptions de droits de scolarité supplémentaires
Inquiries and applications for an exemption should be made directly to the students' own Ministry of Education prior to leaving their home country. In some cases, when the person is in Canada, it may be possible to apply for an exemption at his or her Embassy or Consulate in Canada or in the United States. For up to date contact information from the different eligible countries, please consult the following Ministry PDF document. Liste des responsables de la gestion des exemptions des pays et de l’organisation internationale à qui le gouvernement du Québec accorde des exemptions des droits de scolarité supplémentaires
