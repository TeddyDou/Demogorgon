Overview
Faculty (including retired faculty), staff and students of Concordia University may be eligible to borrow    items in person from other Canadian libraries as described below.
To borrow from other university libraries, it is first necessary to obtain     a BCI card (Bureau de coopération interuniversitaire) card from Concordia University Library, which can be obtained from or Loans & Returns Desk at Webster Library .
When borrowing from other university libraries, please take note of the following:
The borrower must identify himself/herself to the lending library by means of a BCIcard  as well as provide appropriate personal identification (picture ID) for registration.
In requesting a BCI card, the borrower is acknowledging that he/she will respect the policies and procedures of the lending library, including returns and fines policies.
All fines, replacement costs, and other fees are based upon the policies of the lending library. The borrower in arrears may reestablish his/her borrowing privileges once all fines and fees are paid to the lending library.
Borrowed material may be returned at the returns counter of the lending library or to the returns counter of the borrower's home library.
Graduate Students, Faculty and Staff
Concordia University graduate students in Masters, Doctoral or eligible diploma     programs, faculty and staff holding a BCI card are entitled to the same borrowing privileges as those granted to undergraduate students, external or other categories of borrowers, as the case may be. In addition, by virtue of a special agreement amongst the Quebec university libraries, Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec (BAnQ) is also part of the Agreement.
Upon presentation of a valid Concordia ID card, students, faculty         and staff, in good standing, may obtain a BCI card at the Webster Library Loans & Returns desk or Vanier        Library's Circulation Services during service hours.
For more information, please refer to http://www.curba.ca/ .
Undergraduate Students
Full- and part-time undergraduate students who are registered in a     regular program, and in good standing, may have the privilege of borrowing, in person, up     to three (3) items for a maximum of 14 days, without renewal, from other Quebec    university libraries, including the Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec (BAnQ)      and the Institut québecois de la recherche sur la culture.
Upon presentation of a valid Concordia ID card, students, in good standing, may obtain a     BCI card at the Webster Library Loans & Returns desk or Vanier        Library's Circulation Services during service hours.
Joint Study Programs
Faculty and students enrolled in a program that is offered jointly, either by      extension, association or cooperation, between Concordia University and other Quebec     universities, are entitled to the same library services and borrowing privileges as those granted to     faculty and students in a regular program, including     reciprocal borrowing privileges, interlibrary loans,     reserves, reference services and on-site access to     electronic documents and databases.
Upon presentation of a valid Concordia ID card, students, faculty     and staff, in good standing, may obtain a BCI card at the Webster Library Loans & Returns desk or Vanier        Library's Circulation Services during service hours.
For more information, please refer to http://www.curba.ca/ .                        See also: Library Information for Participants in Joint Programs
