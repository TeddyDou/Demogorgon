AAVA IS DEAD BECAUSE OF YOU!!  :/
the aCADEmy of art video art
   Started  by Jacob MacDonnell in 2004/2005 the AAVA has enjoyed much success.  Events often organized with sponsorship from local artist run centers  continue to draw attention from both the Concordia artist community as  well as Montreal’s larger artistic scene. Traditionally organized by  students enrolled in Intermedia (IMCA, Studio Arts, Concordia University), and sometimes, working at the  IMCA Depot, the Academy of Art Video Art is a great opportunity for  student video artists to see their creations displayed outside of the  University context..
