NOV. 14: Testing of warning siren planned near Loyola Campus
Test is part of an emergency exercise by the City of Montreal
Posted on November 9, 2017
On Tuesday, November 14, between 2 and 2:30 p.m., the City of Montreal is holding an emergency exercise of three minutes that involves testing a warning siren .
This will be heard in the west-end of Montreal, including the Loyola Campus.
The city regularly works with local companies using hazardous materials to reduce the risks associated with major industrial accidents.
The test is being done in cooperation with Parmalat Canada Inc., an industrial company that uses ammonia as a coolant to keep products at the proper temperatures. The goal is to test the company’s warning equipment and the response by its emergency team.
The siren test will send out a rising and falling tone that will last three minutes.
Note: there is no action required on your part.
Since sound is influenced by weather conditions, there is the possibility that the siren will be barely audible in some locations of the targeted area.
In the case of a major industrial accident, the warning siren would be immediately activated to advise residents of a dangerous situation within 1,860 metres of the plant. Find out how to prepare yourself in this situation here .
