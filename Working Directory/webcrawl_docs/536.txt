Studying in Quebec
Quebec regulations that affect tuition
All Concordia students, and all university students in Quebec, must register at least once with the  Ministère de l’Éducation et de l’Enseignement supérieur  (MEES). We can help you with the following tasks, because they affect the tuition you will pay at Concordia: 
Register or obtain a permanent code: all Concordia students must have one, given to them by the MEES. 
Qualify for Quebec tuition rates: Only certain students pay Quebec tuition rates. Your qualifcation for this depends on you satisfying MEES guidelines.  
It's important that you read these sections and follow the guidelines provided so you can benefit from one, or both, of these conditions for studying in Quebec.
Permanent code requirement
Every student studying at a Quebec University must have a permanent code or code permanent. This code is assigned by the Ministry. Concordia needs you to have a permanent code. Without one, you will pay an extra differential tuition fee.
Learn more about your permanent code
Quebec Resident Tuition Status
International students, Canadian Citizens and Permanent Residents in Undergraduate and Graduate programs at Concordia pay higher tuition fees than Quebec residents.
To pay Quebec resident tuition fees, you must qualify as a Quebec resident under MEES definitions. 
Learn how to qualify and register for Quebec resident tuition status
French Study Fee Exemption
If you do not qualify for Quebec Resident Tuition Status (as outlined above), you normally have to pay additional tuition fees. However, if you register in approved French programs or courses, these fees maybe waived.
Learn about French study fee exemptions
International Fee Exemptions
Some international students qualify for Quebec tuition fee rates under MEES rgulations. See if you qualify.
