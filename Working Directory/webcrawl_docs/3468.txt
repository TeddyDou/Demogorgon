Issue 12: Launch at Skol
Friday, April 28th, 2017
Interfold hosted the launch of our 12th issue, Intercept, at Le Centre des arts actuels Skol. This exhibition featured the exceptional work of thirteen Concordia Undergraduate students, all working in a variety of mediums and conceptual considerations. We  had a captivating performance during the event by one of our contibutors, local musician NOVEMBER .
The themes for this issue revolve around the artist's touch, exhibiting works that reflect on embodied experience, facets of identity and artist's engagement with the artistic process. This issue alternated between interviews and collaborative texts to draw these thematic connections between our selected artworks. These texts bridged artist's statements about their work with interpretations from our editing team, exploring the ways that meaning is negotiated between artists, viewers and writers.
