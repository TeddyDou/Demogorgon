BLOCHACKS – A social impact hackathon  - Fall 2017
November 25, 2017 – November 26, 2017, 12 p.m. – 12 p.m.
Organized by the Refugee Centre
This is a 24h event starting November 25, 12 P.M. finishing Sunday November 26, 12 P.M..
BLOCHACKS is the first annual hackathon in the city of Montreal that is focused on mainly hacking Social Causes. We are strong believers that technology can help fix and improve the majority of disasters and social problems the world is currently facing today. We see an ever increasing gap between the Non-Profit (as well as Non-Governmental) world and current technology. Supported by the Social Innovation Catalyst known as DevBloc, we believe we can help motivate and inspire the Montreal community to build, create, structure, design, and innovate solutions to the world's more pressing issues.
You may register a team of 3 to 6 people, or register as an individual and we will team you up with others.
This is a very exciting opportunity for people to meet with big tech companies and showcase their skills all while working on something to better the lives of refugees.
What is a hackathon? (by wikepedia)
A hackathon (also known as a hack day, hackfest or codefest) is a design sprint-like event in which computer programmers and others involved in software development , including graphic designers , interface designers , project managers , and others, often including subject-matter-experts, collaborate intensively on software projects. [1]
The goal of a hackathon is to create usable software. Hackathons tend to have a specific focus, which can include the programming language used, the operating system , an application, an API , or the subject and the demographic group of the programmers. In other cases, there is no restriction on the type of software being created.
Date & Time:
Sat, 25 Nov 2017, 12:00 PM
Sun, 26 Nov 2017, 12:00 PM
