Conduct on campus
If have been accused of breaking an academic rule, or if you feel that someone has treated you unfairly, there are several services – both formal and informal – at Concordia that will enable you to assert your rights or resolve a conflict. If you find yourself in a difficult situation, contact one of the offices below and they can help.
Consult a student advocate
If you ever face charges under the Academic Code of Conduct or the Code of Rights and Responsibilities , you have people who can help you. 
Student Advocacy Program
The Student Advocacy Program (SAP) has advocates who are specifically trained and experienced to help you through difficult situations. Our advocates help you through the entire process which includes meetings with associate deans, hearings, and appeals.

Standards of conduct on campus

The office administers Concordia's Code of Rights and Responsibilities, which sets standards of conduct for all University students, faculty, and staff.
