Hello guys,
As some of you may know, CISA is an association that doesn’t receive any funding. In order to organize more events and sell them at cheaper rates, we need to become a Fee Levy Association.
To be part of a referendum, we need 750 signatures.
We are looking for people that would help us get signatures by asking their classmates or by going around the campus explaining who we are and what we do to those who are not aware.
If you are interested in helping us, please send us a message and we will explain you everything!
(There will be a compensation) ... See MoreSee Less
