Media Studies (MA)
Master of Arts (MA)
Offered by:
Department of Communication Studies , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why pursue a Master's in Media Studies?
Traditional and emerging media technologies and platforms affect the way we perceive the world and our place in it. As producers and consumers of different forms of media, we are actively participating in an environment that gives agency to certain individuals, groups and movements over others. Now more than ever, we need academic researchers and creators to examine the social, political and cultural dimensions of various forms of media.
The MA in Media Studies provides you with an environment to further your command of contemporary media culture, history and theory. Our renowned faculty members will supply you with an interdisciplinary formation to media studies that integrates knowledge based in the humanities, liberal arts, social sciences and fine arts.
Our students benefit from an exceptionally active research culture led by a multitude of faculty research initiatives and creations . This vibrant setting will encourage and challenge you to pursue your own research interests in areas as varied as community activism, video games and feminist media.
Our MA students are looking at topics such as:
race, indigeneity, and transmedia art in contemporary Canada
narratives of class and empire in honeymoon advertisements
environmental storytelling in game studies
the interplay between media and identity for northern Aboriginal girls
photographs as a site where lost neighbourhoods are made visible
