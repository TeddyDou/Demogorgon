The Fine Arts Student Alliance (FASA) is an accredited student association, comprised by all students enrolled in a Major, Minor or Specialization within the Fine Arts. FASA is funded by all Fine Arts students through a fee levy of $2.05 per credit.
The Alliance is run by six elected Coordinators, who manage day-to-day operations, alongside the Board of Directors, which is made up of delegates from Fine Art Clubs and Affiliates. The six elected coordinators are: the General Coordinator, Clubs and Services Coordinator, External Communications Coordinator, Internal Communications Coordinator, Special Events Coordinator, and Finance Coordinator. Together, the six Coordinators alongside the Adjunct to the Coordinators work to program a wide range of diverse events and activities on campus as well as in the Montreal community, administer Special Project Grants, support Fine Arts clubs, and seek out various ways to represent and recognize Concordiaâ€™s creative community.
