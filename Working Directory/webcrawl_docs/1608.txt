Welcome
CSU’s OutLoud Orientation is for any student, from any faculty.
All of the events are free to attend, and aim to reach out to students through a variety of social events, activities and workshops. It’s a chance to get to know your campus, your community and your peers.
Come learn a new skill, discover a new band, or just enjoy a burger on the Hall Terrace. We are looking forward to meeting you! If you have any questions, please speak to a member of the CSU Orientation Team or come by the CSU Offices (H711).
