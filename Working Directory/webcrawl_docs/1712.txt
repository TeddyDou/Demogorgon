Loyola 100 – Then and now
One hundred years ago, Loyola College, one of Concordia's two founding institutions, welcomed students to its new west-end campus. Construction of Loyola on the old Decary farm began in 1913.
Although the first students moved there in 1915 even before the buildings were completed, the move was complete in 1916.
To celebrate the occasion, Concordia Alumni Relations put together a video to highlight Loyola's past and its present.
Discover how this professor honoured his family’s memory
On June 23, 1985, Mahesh Sharma, a professor from the John Molson School of Business at Concordia, lost his wife, daughters and mother-in-law in the fatal bombing of Air India Flight 182.
Sharma recounts the events of that day and explains how a planned gift to Concordia University has allowed him to cherish the beloved memory of his family. Liana Di Iorio, a recipients of the Sandhya and Swati Sharma Memorial Scholarship, explains how Sharma's scholarship has reassured her in her studies. 
Di-Octo: Mesmerizing, kinetic and unique
The towering Di-Octo sculpture outside the southwest corner of Concordia’s Henry F. Hall Building is unique and enthralling
The kinetic artwork was generously donated to the city and university on the occasion of Montreal’s 375th and Canada’s 150th anniversaries by Concordia Chancellor, Montreal businessman and philanthropist Jonathan Wener, BComm 71, and his wife Susan Wener.
Student by day, taxi driver by night
Hardy Grewal, BComm 83, a Concordia graduate who had $7 in his pocket when he immigrated to North America in the 1970s, went on to become a business magnate in Canada and the United States. 
He is now CEO and president of Los Angeles-based OhCal Foods — one of the largest Subway restaurant developers in North America. Grewal paid his success forward with a $1 million gift to support the next generation of students.
This video features footage of Grewal with university leaders at his gift announcement on April 25, 2016.
