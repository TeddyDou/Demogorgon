Club Description: 
Biosignal Systems is a group focused on wearable technologies. With projects and events focused on exploring virtually all modern wearables, from smartwatches and virtual reality headsets to EEG headsets, body sensors, voice recognition and motion sensors. We seek to understand the world of brain-computer-interfaces to interpret brain waves, and develop applications ranging from accessibility (controlling artificial limbs) to psychology (assisted meditation) to entertainment (games that respond to your state of mind).
