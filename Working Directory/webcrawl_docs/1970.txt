Political Science (PhD)
Doctorate (PhD)
Offered by:
Department of Political Science , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why pursue a Doctorate in Political Science?
Deepen your advanced training and creativity as an independent researcher while working alongside experts in Canadian and Quebec politics, comparative politics, international relations, political theory, and public administration and public policy. Conduct primary research through surveys, archival data collection and fieldwork as you develop an original contribution to the discipline.
The PhD in Political Science provides a stimulating environment for you to examine disciplinary subfields and gain a breadth of understanding in two areas of specialization. Research-active faculty members will help refine your analytical and writing skills, enabling you to better prepare your research for publication in top-ranking peer-reviewed academic journals.
Students have recently been published in multiple periodicals, including:
Ageing and Society
Canadian Journal of African Studies
Canadian Political Science Review
Electoral Studies
International Journal of Canadian Studies
International Journal of Public Administration
Journal of Defense Studies
Public Organization Review
Urbanités
Benefit from faculty-led inter-institutional and university-wide research networks , such as the Centre for the Study of Democratic Citizenship (CSDC) , the Lab for Latin American and Caribbean Studies, and the Groupe de recherche interuniversitaire en philosophie politique de Montréal (GRIPP). Our students have also found great success funding their research through fellowships and awards from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, the Fonds de recherche du Québec – Société et culture, GRIPP Montreal, and the CSDC.
Program details
Degree requirements
Requirements for the Degree
Credits. A fully qualified candidate is required to complete a minimum of 90 credits. In order to fulfill the requirements of the program, students will select two areas of specialization. The requirements are 21 credits of course work, 12 credits in the form of two comprehensive exams, 3 credits of thesis proposal, and 54 credits of thesis.
Courses (21 credits). All candidates must take seven 3-credit courses as described below:
All students will select two areas of specialization (for example Canadian Politics and International Politics). Course work is divided into core courses and elective courses. Each student will take:
2 core courses, one in each of the two chosen areas of specialization (POLI 801-805 Advanced Seminars);
2 elective courses, one in each of the same two chosen areas of specialization (POLI 811-815);
1 core course in public policy (POLI 805), where public policy is one of the two chosen areas of specialization, the elective course is to be selected from a third area;
1 elective course from any area of specialization or a cognate course in a related field;
1 methods course (POLI 844).
 
Comprehensive Examination (12 credits in the form of 2 comprehensive examinations). All candidates are required to write two 6-credit comprehensive exams in their two areas of specialization, so that they are deemed competent to teach at the university level in these two areas. For each area of specialization there will be a written exam and an oral defence of the exam within three weeks of writing the former. Students must pass the written exam to move forward to the oral exam, but can still fail an exam with an incompetent oral performance. If either part (written or oral) is failed, the student will be permitted one re-take of the entire exam both oral and written. If the student then fails either the written or oral part, the second failure will result in the student being withdrawn from the program.
Thesis Proposal (3 credits). After completion of the course work and comprehensive exams, the candidate with the concurrence and assistance of the Graduate Program Director finalizes the supervisory committee, consisting of the principal supervisor(s) and at least  two other members of the department. Students are required to complete and defend their thesis proposal before the supervisory committee in a meeting chaired by the Graduate Program Director. The thesis proposal will include a literature review and a fully justified research agenda. In cases where the supervisory committee is not satisfied with the proposal, the student can resubmit and re-defend. A second unsatisfactory proposal would result in the student being withdrawn from the program.
Thesis (54 credits). Doctoral students must submit a thesis based on their research and defend it in an oral examination. A doctoral thesis should be based on extensive research in primary sources, make an original contribution to knowledge, and be presented in acceptable scholarly form.
Language Requirement. PhD candidates must demonstrate an ability to conduct research either in French or in a language (other than English) required in their area of research.
Admission requirements
Admission Requirements. Admission to the PhD in Political Science requires a Master of/Magisteriate in Arts in political science, political studies, international relations, public policy, or another relevant field from an accredited university. A superior academic record and strong references are both essential; professional work experience will be taken into consideration. Applicants are selected on the basis of past academic record, letters of recommendation, statement of purpose, writing sample, and the relevance of their proposed research to the research expertise in the department. Enrolment in the PhD in Political Science is limited in part by the availability of research supervisors.
Proficiency in English. Applicants whose primary language is not English must demonstrate that their knowledge of English is sufficient to pursue graduate studies in their chosen field. Please refer to the  Graduate Admission page  for further information on the Language Proficiency requirements and exemptions.
