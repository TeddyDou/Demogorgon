Social and Cultural Anthropology (MA)
Master of Arts (MA)
Offered by:
Department of Sociology & Anthropology , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why pursue a Master's in Social and Cultural Analysis?
The MA in Social and Cultural Anthropology provides the opportunity to engage in a substantial fieldwork project where the researcher works closely with research subjects and gains an understanding of their experiences and of the ways in which they construct meaningful lives. Fieldwork projects are individualized, giving you the freedom to choose a topic or/and a community to work with in consultation with your supervisor.
Students may also choose to pursue a year-long, essay (non-thesis) option that requires them to engage in a broad and rigorous study of anthropological literature. This course of study is well-suited for students who wish to dedicate more energy to course work and those looking for a faster point of entry into a Doctoral program.
Our research-active faculty members produce work that has been recognized by many Canadian research agencies, including the Canada Research Chairs Program. Faculty also sit on editorial boards for a number of leading peer-reviewed journals such as Anthropologica, and The Senses and Society.
Join an intimate cohort of students whose work cuts across traditional research areas. Research topics that our current students are examining include:
gender and feminism
colonialism and expansion
media and technology
food and sustainability
utopian and dystopian futures
Program Details
Program options & degree requirements
You may choose one of two options.
Option A: MA with thesis
Option B: MA with essay
Students enrolled in option A are required to demonstrate their ability to carry out independent ethnographic field research. A thesis proposal serves as the basis for the elaboration of the written thesis.
Option B is a one year program that asks students to write a research essay under the supervision of a faculty member. Essays are evaluated by two faculty members, including the supervisor, and can be either a literature review or a report on empirical research.
Requirements for the Degree
Credits. A fully-qualified candidate is required to complete a minimum of 45 credits. Additional courses may be taken from outside the program, subject to the advice and approval of the student’s supervisor or the Graduate Program Director.
Supervision. Students are assigned an interim advisor upon admission. Students in the thesis option must select their permanent advisor by the beginning of the second term, along with a second committee member. Their thesis is evaluated by the two-person committee and a third examiner. Students in the non-thesis option select a permanent advisor by the beginning of the second term, and their final research papers are evaluated by the advisor and a second examiner.
Language Requirement. A working knowledge of English and French is recommended, although written work may be submitted in either language. Where appropriate, students are encouraged to acquire competence in the language of the community they choose to study; this may be achieved in the context of ANTH 640.
Consult the graduate calendar for full degree requirements.
Admission requirements
Admission Requirements. An undergraduate degree with honours or specialization in anthropology or joint specialization in anthropology and sociology, with a grade point average of 3.00 (B average) is required.

Previous editions have seen students from across Quebec and Canada present their research and foster dialogue across disciplines. Keynote speakers from past conferences have included Dr. Ram Jahku, Dr. Charmaine A. Nelson, Dr. Alexandrine Boudreault-Fournier and Dr. Daniel Dagenais.
The Disestablishmentarian is a bi-annual peer-reviewed publication administered under the editorial direction of graduate students in the Department of Sociology & Anthropology. The journal is strongly interdisciplinary and intended for emerging scholars of social and cultural analysis.
