Carbon Dioxide: can’t live with it, can’t live without it.
Most people are very confused about what to do with our growing carbon dioxide challenge. This confusion is creating great uncertainty amongst the general public, media, industry, business, policy makers and governments. It is also creating anxiety about the future we can expect for our children.
In this lecture Geoffrey Ozin will explore whether chemistry and engineering strategies for transforming carbon dioxide into renewable fuels can provide a solution to this grand challenge.
Geoffrey Ozin is currently the Tier 1 Canada Research Chair in Materials Chemistry and Nanochemistry and Distinguished University Professor at the University of Toronto, where he currently spearheads the activities of the Solar Fuels Cluster. Recently he has been the recipient of the World Technology Network Award in Energy and the RSC Centenary Prize and the Albert Einstein Prize for his work in defining, enabling and popularising a chemical approach to nanomaterials for innovative nanotechnology in advanced materials and biomedical science.
A reception was held after the presentation where a poster session showcasing current Concordia nanoscience research was displayed. Concordia Research Centres shared information about their groundbreaking work.
 
This event was part of Science Odyssey 2017, a ten-day national campaign of discovery and innovation to celebrate Canadian achievements in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).
