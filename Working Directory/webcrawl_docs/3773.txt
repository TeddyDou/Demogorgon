Volunteers
JMAS is constantly looking for volunteers to help out with our various events throughout the year. If you want to get involved in school but you’re not quite sure how to go about it, or you just want to get a taste of JMAS events, this is a great opportunity for you. Whether you want to volunteer at only one or at most of our events, you are welcome to sign up with the form below.
As a volunteer, your responsibility is to help out wherever you can. Whether it be assembling and distributing name tags, greeting guests at the entrance, helping with setup and cleanup, or taking care of the food and drinks. We’re looking for people who can support the team and do all the little things right. As a volunteer you are part of our team, and we value your time and effort.
We look forward to working with you and making new friends along the way!
If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to email efeyenia.hatto@jmas.ca
