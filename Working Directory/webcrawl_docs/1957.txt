Mathematics (MA, MSc)
Master of Arts (MA), Master of Science (MSc)
Offered by:
Department of Mathematics & Statistics , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why pursue a Master's in Mathematics?
From big data to corporate finance, intelligence analysis to operational research, professionals with mathematics degrees  tackle complex problems in an array of fast-evolving fields.  With over thirty faculty members , you will benefit  from close working relationships within  Montreal, an international research hub in the area of mathematical sciences. By the end of the program, you will have advanced your research skills, and ready to apply mathematical expertise in the industry or pursue doctoral studies.
You will benefit from Concordia’s association with the ISM (Institut des sciences mathématiques) and the CRM (Centre de recherches mathématiques), by choosing to take courses at any of the four universities in Montreal, register to workshops and participate in collaborative projects throughout your studies. Broaden your research network by participating in seminars and presentations given by leading  professors, post-doctoral fellows and adjunct faculty members.
The department engages with the community, by hosting or participating in mathematic competitions for elementary to high school students or by sponsoring math competitions. Enrich your graduate experience and take part in math outreach activities.
