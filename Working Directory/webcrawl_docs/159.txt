Who We Are
JMMA believes in merging both the academic and professional worlds of marketing.
We influence students to be curious and prepare them to be ready
for the challenges and obstacles of marketing!
The John Molson Marketing Association is a versatile team of motivated and wildly imaginative students who strive to enlighten the minds of our fellow classmates by encouraging them to explore, create and stay curious.
Workshops, conferences and social networking events are only a few opportunities we offer to students in order to bridge the gap between being a student and having a career in marketing.
It is our mission to give marketing students the most fulfilling university career and a non-literal toolbag to prepare them for their professional lives ahead. This year we are a team of 13 dedicated individuals with a passion for marketing and we’re dizzy with excitement for the year ahead.
