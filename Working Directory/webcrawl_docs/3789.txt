As we begin a new academic year, the John Molson Accounting Society is proud to host our annual Dividends Magazine Launch Cocktail. Dividends is our annual in-house publication, featuring articles related to the accounting profession, academic tips as well as tricks and a revamped lifestyle section focusing on the whole University Experience
The cocktail will be hosted on Tuesday August 29th at the Fairmont – Queen Elizabeth Hotel. The event will start at 6pm, where alcoholic beverages and canapés will be served. Each guest will receive their own copy of our Dividends magazine, and will be able to network with fellow students, firm representatives, faculty members, and the new JMAS team.
We would like to take this opportunity to welcome students back to school, and to kick off the year in style. We cordially invite you to attend our Dividends Magazine Launch cocktail.
The cocktail takes place on:
