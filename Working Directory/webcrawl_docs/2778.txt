User Content and Conduct Policy
Google’s social and sharing products and services enable people from diverse             backgrounds to start conversations, share experiences, collaborate on projects, and             form new communities. Our policies play an important role in maintaining a positive             experience for our users on the products listed below (collectively referred to as the             “Services”). Please follow these policies as you:
use Google+, including Google+ comments on other products such as Blogger
participate in publicly shared Hangouts or Hangouts on Air
send Hangouts invitations
share content by link or print content through Google Photos.
We depend heavily upon users to let us know about content that may violate our             policies. After we are notified of a potential policy violation, we may review the             content and take action, including restricting access to the content, removing the             content, refusing to print the content and limiting or terminating a user’s access to             Google products. Note that we may make exceptions to these policies based on artistic,             educational, or documentary considerations, or when there are other substantial             benefits to the public from not taking action.
We occasionally modify these policies, so please check back here for any updates.             Beyond the policies listed below, note that several products and features may have             additional policies and terms — please check the links provided for those additional             requirements.
Illegal Activities
Do not use our Services to engage in illegal activities or to promote activities                 that are dangerous and illegal, such as terrorism, the sale of illegal drugs, or                 human trafficking.
We may also remove content that violates applicable local laws. To report content                 that you believe should be removed based on local laws, click here .
Malicious and Deceptive Practices
Do not transmit viruses, malware, or any other malicious or destructive code. Do                 not distribute content that harms or interferes with the operation of the networks,                 servers, or other infrastructure of Google or others. Do not use our Services for                 phishing scams.
Hate Speech
Our products are platforms for free expression. But we don't support content that                 promotes or condones violence against individuals or groups based on race or ethnic                 origin, religion, disability, gender, age, nationality, veteran status, or sexual                 orientation/gender identity, or whose primary purpose is inciting hatred on the                 basis of these core characteristics. This can be a delicate balancing act, but if                 the primary purpose is to attack a protected group, the content crosses the line.
Harassment, Bullying, and Threats
Do not engage in harassing, bullying, or threatening behavior, and do not incite                 others to engage in these activities. Anyone using our Services to single someone                 out for malicious abuse, to threaten someone with serious harm, to sexualize a                 person in an unwanted way, or to harass in other ways may have the offending                 content removed or be permanently banned from using the Services. In emergency                 situations, we may escalate imminent threats of serious harm to law enforcement.                 Keep in mind that online harassment is also illegal in many places and can have                 serious offline consequences for both the harasser and the victim.
Learn more about                 additional steps that you can take to stop harassment and bullying on Google+.
Personal and Confidential Information
Do not distribute other people’s personal and confidential information, such as                 credit card numbers, confidential national ID numbers, or account passwords,                 without their permission. Do not post or distribute images or videos of minors                 without the necessary consent from their legal representatives. Report a                 violation
Child Exploitation
Do not upload or share content that exploits or abuses children. This includes all                 child sexual abuse imagery (even cartoon images) and all content that presents                 children in a sexual manner. We will remove such content and take appropriate                 action, which may include disabling accounts and reporting to the National Center                 for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) and law enforcement. Note that this                 policy may additionally apply to any content uploaded or transmitted through our                 Services.
If you find any content that you think exploits children in this manner, do not +1,                 reshare or comment on such content, even if your intent is to bring it to Google’s                 attention. Instead, flag the content through the ‘ Report                 Abuse ’ link. If you find content elsewhere on the internet, please contact NCMEC directly.
Spam
Do not spam, including by sending unwanted promotional or commercial content, or                 unwanted or mass solicitation.
Do not aggressively send invitations, add people to your circles, or message people                 that you do not know.
Ranking Manipulation
Do not manipulate ranking or relevancy using techniques like repetitive or                 misleading keywords or metadata.
Sexually Explicit Material
Do not distribute sexually explicit or pornographic material. Do not drive traffic                 to commercial pornography sites.
We do allow naturalistic and documentary depictions of nudity (such as an image of                 a breastfeeding infant), as well as depictions of nudity that serve a clear                 educational, scientific, or artistic purpose.
Note that your Google+ profile photo cannot include mature or offensive content.                 For example, do not use a photo that is a close-up of a person’s buttocks or cleavage.
Violence
Do not distribute depictions of graphic or gratuitous violence.
Regulated Goods and Services
Our Services enable discussion of many topics, but we do not allow content that                 facilitates the sale of regulated products and services, including alcohol,                 gambling, pharmaceuticals and unapproved supplements, tobacco, fireworks, weapons,                 or health/medical devices.
Because these topics are often heavily regulated and may not be appropriate for all                 ages or in all countries, we have created tools on Google+ to help you target your                 content to users of the appropriate ages in the right markets. If your content                 promotes regulated goods and services, you are responsible for applying the                 appropriate age and geographical restrictions for that content where these tools                 are available. If we receive a complaint that such content is targeting audiences                 in violation of applicable laws and regulations, we may remove or restrict the                 offending content or account.
Even with the appropriate age and geographical restrictions in place, we still do                 not allow the facilitation of the sale of the products listed above.
Learn                 more about audience settings on Google+.
Impersonation
Do not use our Services to mislead or confuse users by pretending to be someone                 else or pretending to represent an organization you do not represent. Some products                 have additional guidelines: Learn more about                 Impersonation on Google+.
Account Hijacking
Do not access another user’s account without their permission.
Use of Multiple Accounts
Do not create or use multiple accounts to evade our policies or bypass blocks or                 otherwise subvert restrictions placed on your account. For example, if you’ve been                 blocked by another user or suspended for abuse, don’t create a replacement account                 that engages in similar activity.
About our Policies and Terms
These policies apply generally to the content you post on our Services. Some services             have their own separate policies that can be found within those services and apply to             your use of them. All Google products and services are governed by their applicable             terms of service.

If you encounter content or a user that you believe violates the above policies, please             report it to us using the “Report Abuse” link (or similarly named link). Learn more             about reporting abuse on Google+ , Hangouts invitations ,             and Google             Photos .
