Student Academic Services
Student Academic Services is the first-stop source of information for all students who are enrolled in the Faculty of Fine Arts, who are enrolled in other faculties but are taking Fine Arts courses, or who have questions of any kind at all about the Faculty.
Front-desk staff provide a wealth of information and advice about negotiating the administrative structure of the Faculty and the University as a whole, and, if necessary, can refer students to the department office and personnel best able to help them. Behind the scenes, academic counsellors provide more detailed advice and information on a by-appointment basis.
