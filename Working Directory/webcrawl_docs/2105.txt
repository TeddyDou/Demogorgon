Law and Society (Minor)
Offered by:
Department of History , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why study Law and Society?
Law affects all aspects of our lives. It structures our social, economic and political relationships, it allocates property, it defines crime and deviance, and it frames controversial ethical, moral and political debates. As the influence of legal institutions in society grows, it becomes increasingly important for students to have an informed understanding of how law works and how it affects social relations. In this minor program, students will study law in an interdisciplinary way – not as a set of rules, but as an important discourse within society (in Quebec, in Canada and globally). Students will study issues such as governance, crime, conflict and social justice from the perspectives of sociology, history, anthropology, political science and philosophy, among others.
Program details
Program options
The Minor in Law and Society (24 credits) must be combined with an honours, specialization or major program.
