Mailing List Help
Here are the full details regarding our mailing lists:
The LSA sends out its announcements to two mailing lists, lingthing and lingmont, both of which are powered by Concordia’s Majordomo service.
Lingthing caters to the Concordia linguistics crowd, and as such includes all LSA updates and announcements. To subscribe, send an email to majordomo@concordia.ca with “subscribe lingthing” included in the body.
Lingmont has a broader intended audience and deals with all linguistics-related events and talks around the Montreal area. The LSA sends out invitations to the talks it organizes on lingmont. As a general rule, lingmont updates are a subset of lingthing ones. To subscribe, send an email to majordomo@concordia.ca with “subscribe lingmont” included in the body.
