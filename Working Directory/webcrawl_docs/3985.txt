Rocketry
The rocketry division is dedicated to the design, manufacturing, testing and operation of high-power sounding rockets.
About the Rocketry Division
The Rocketry division aims to compete in the Intercollegiate Rocket Engineering Competition (IREC). This is a yearly competition which hosts some of the top aerospace engineering schools in the world. The team brings together students from all disciplines to design and build a sounding rocket.
Competition Overview
The competition that the Rocketry Division usually participates in is the basic category of the Intercollegiate Rocket Engineering Competition, more commonly referred to as IREC. The basic requirements of a rocket in this competition is to send a 10 pound experimental payload to an altitude of 10,000 feet and to return the entire system safely to the ground. The competition encourages the teams to attempt to do meaningful scientific research with their rockets. As well, additional points are awarded to teams that manufacture a large portion of their rocket in-house.
Additional difficulties are incurred by the competition environment. To comply with Federal regulations, the experimental launches must be held in the high desert of Utah, near the town of Green River. This means that the Rocketry Division must prepare the rocket for launch in the punishing desert environment, making the preparation of field operations of paramount importance to the division.
