Cell and Molecular Biology (BSc)
Bachelor of Science (BSc)
Offered by:
Department of Biology , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why study Cell and Molecular Biology?
Map genes. Examine microbes. Crack the secrets of the genome, the program of life. When you study Cell and Molecular Biology, you get a front-row seat to study the basic processes that run life’s playbook. As a cell and molecular biologist, you can discover how genes shape organisms, how immune cells protect our body and how biotechnology can develop pest- or drought-resistant crops for the developing world.
Our Biology Department laboratories feature modern equipment and protocols that introduce you to state-of-the-art technologies for cell physiology and molecular biology. Small class sizes foster strong student-professor relationships. As a Cell and Molecular Biology student, you'll follow both the biology core curriculum and courses focused within your specialization. Through labs, lectures and tutorials you will:
Study the mechanisms of cellular interactions and genetic controls in plants and animals
Study the structure and function of microbes
Learn the techniques used to study genetic function, gene mapping and genome analysis
Perform original research as an undergraduate
Concordia’s hands-on approach provides a solid foundation for a career in the life and health sciences or paves the way for future graduate studies.
