Afternoon Tea & Board Games!
November 23, 2017, 3 p.m. – 4:30 p.m.
Every two weeks on Thursdays, ISO invites you to discover – and enjoy! - different teas from around the world while having a relaxing time with Concordia’s international students’ community. For this special occasion, our workshop (GM 340) room will turn into a cozy lounge area, which will enhance the tea tasting and chilling experience!
Plus, we will also have an awesome selection of board games (from monopoly to Jenga!) from which guests are free to choose and play!
To participate, please, register  here .
