AVEQ Community Action Fund - Volunteer position
Nov 08, 2017
abadr
 
COMMUNITY ACTION FUND
One of the primary goals of the Association for the Voice of Education in Quebec ( AVEQ ) is to support local student-led initiatives. One way to do this is through funding. Last year, the Community Action Fund was set up to promote collaborative projects involving students and other community groups.
 
 
Meetings will occur as needed, with one initial meeting to review policy and set up the application process for the year, and one or more per semester to review the applications received by a set deadline. The meetings will be held bilingually by webconference (Google Hangouts), with people speaking in their preferred language. It is notable that applications will also be submitted in English or French (so working understanding and reading comprehension of both English and French is strongly preferable, but accommodations can be made if necessary).
