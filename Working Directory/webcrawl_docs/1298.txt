About the Visualization Studio
The Visualization Studio is a visualization environment; an innovative,  collaborative and interdisciplinary creative facility for research, teaching  and learning, situated in the Webster Library.
The Visualization Studio supports new and experimental modes of research,  emerging technologies and interdisciplinary collaborative work; and offers  immersive visualizations and visualization analytics.
The studio will open its doors in February 2018.
Project Description
To celebrate the Library’s recent renovation, the Concordia Library is looking  for creative members of the Concordia community -- designers, scientists, engineers,  creatives, artist groups, etc. -- to create an audiovisual or visual piece to  display on the Visualization Studio’s interactive wall. The commission piece will  mark the launch of the Visualization Studio and will be used to showcase the potential  of the studio and its interactive wall. The selected work will also be presented to a  passing audience.
Artwork on the Visualization Studio’s interactive wall can function as a form  of communication to an audience in transit through the Library, with the goal  of creating a vibrant and interesting environment.
Successful content submissions must be innovative in design and engaging. Submissions that are interactive, playful and immersive are encouraged.
Selected submissions will be used to showcase the space as one of the main  demo pieces in the Visualization Studio, and will be displayed on the interactive  wall outside of work hours and when the studio is not in use.
This means that submissions must be first and foremost functional as standalones  without any technical supervision, and must run from the graphical workstation,  which is the main computer in the Visualization Studio. Pieces can be augmented  with VR, interactivity and sensors, but must remain functional as a plug-and-play  function so they can be put on display and occupy the whole wall when the studio is locked.
Applicants whose work is selected will be asked to showcase a prototype in January 2018.  The final piece must be operational by March 2018.
Selection Criteria
Submissions to the call will be reviewed and assessment made on the following:
Ability of the proposed piece to showcase the potential of the Visualization Studio
Ability of the proposed piece to create a sense of wonder and immersion
Adherence to timelines as described in the above documentation
Merit based on previous work and capacity to deliver
Art Location Description
The Visualization Studio is 36 ft wide and 25 ft long. There is a 23 ft wide window opposite the interactive wall, which interfaces with the hallway.
The interactive wall display will remain turned on outside of opening hours and will act as a digital space for public exhibits, public art, etc.
