The Leonard and Bina Ellen Art Gallery presents and produces exhibitions, events, activities and publications focused on artmaking today and on its recent history as it interfaces with various curatorial strategies. Its program, in the form of exhibitions or performative events presented between September and April, responds to the communities, issues, tensions, projections, and changes that shape the society we live in. The work of Concordia students in graduate visual arts programs is featured in Ignition every spring. The Gallery also houses a collection of Canadian and Québécois art.
