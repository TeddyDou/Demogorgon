STUDIOS AND TOPICS
ARTE 606-9/806-7 Studio Inquiry (3 credits each): Studio Inquiry:
The Art of Urban Resilience and Change
Semester: Fall  Day & Time: Thursdays 14:00-18:00 (Class) Place: Atwater Library (a short walk from Concordia) Instructor: Kathleen Vaughan, Kathleen.Vaughan@concordia.ca
Sited at the Atwater Library, this place-based studio course will invite students to develop artwork to respond to and interpret aspects of the immediate neighbourhood, which represents Montreal’s densest area. What role can the arts play in interpreting and representing this locale, whose population is highly diverse (including newcomers to Canada, university students, First Nations and Inuit, the relics of the privilege of the Dorchester Mansions and Shaughnessy Village, new condo dwellers, shelter clients and more) and changing through rapid gentrification and burgeoning development? How can art help connect and reflect the local communities and their histories? Students will explore these questions through site visits, readings, collaborations, and hands on visual practice, either individually developed or linked to neighbourhood social service agencies or cultural institutions (e.g. the Canadian Centre for Architecture). This course will be aligned with parallel courses in the History and Art History Departments, in a new iteration of the " Right to the City ." Students in all three courses will together present course outcomes in a linked final showcase/exhibition at the Atwater Library in December 2017.
ARTE 660/850Q Selected Topics in Art Education (3 credits):
Performance and Pedagogy
Semester: Fall  Day & Time: Tuesday 16:00-18:00 Place: EV- 6.735
Instructor: MJ Thompson, mj.thompson@concordia.ca
How have considerations of performance and performativity informed theories of pedagogy? And how has pedagogy been reimagined as an artistic strategy?  This class begins with the mise-en-scene of the classroom, considering the role of the teacher as performer and the classroom as site of environmental theatre; and builds on contemporary understandings of artistic labour as pedagogic strategy. Reading between the fields of performance studies, art history and art education, we will explore contemporary strategies around social practice and guerrilla pedagogy. Grounding our work in critical readings and fieldwork in the city, we will pay particular attention to the local environment and resistant performances associated with Montreal 375.
ARTE 660/850R Selected Topics in Art Education (3 credits):
Theories of Complexity, Networks, Mobility and Spatiality in Learning
Semester: Winter Day & Time: Tuesday 16:00 – 18:00 Place: EV-6.735
Instructor: Juan Carlos Castro JuanCarlos.Castro@concordia.ca
In this seminar course students will engage with theories of learning that account for collectives, connectivity, movement, materials, space and time in art education. Students will select an appropriate theory to frame their research needs, which can include, but is not limited to: a conference paper, curriculum design, a literature review for a thesis or dissertation, or scholarly manuscript for publication.
