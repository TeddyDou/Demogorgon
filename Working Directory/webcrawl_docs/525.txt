Congrats Concordia grads!
Congrats Concordia grads!
November 20, 2017 4:42:00 AM EST
Congratulations! Your diploma is a symbol of your success and hard work here at Concordia! Show off this official statement in a genuine Concordia or John Molson School of Business diploma frame. You can purchase one of our many diploma frame options at the Concordia Book Stop Boutique  or online.
Choose from the simplicity of a diploma cover with the university seal in gold foil or with an embossed gold seal. Our diploma frames are all hand crafted wood frame with acid-free matting with the university logo. Make your selection from the five options of diploma frames available in cherry or mahogany wood. Whether in your home or office, tell the world that you are a Concordia graduate!
Concordia rings
Graduating from Concordia is an accomplishment. When you wear a Concordia Ring , you wear a lasting symbol of that accomplishment – and a daily reminder of your university days.
Concordia Rings can be as individual as you are. Include your year of graduation, your degree, a birthstone, a gemstone – the options go on and on. Stop by the Concordia Book Stop Boutique at the Sir George Williams campus or at the Loyola campus, for a free brochure and check our selection in store.
 
Shop for Concordia gear
The Concordia Book Stop Boutique is the official store for all Concordia, John Molson School of Business (JMSB) and Stingers apparel and gifts. We offer the finest quality clothing, gift and memorabilia featuring the Concordia, JMSB or Stingers name or logo that you can wear proudly. We also stock an assortment of sportswear from Under Armour.
