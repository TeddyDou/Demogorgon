Firm Tours & Seminars
*CLICK HERE FOR AN OVERVIEW OF ALL FIRM TOURS*
Registration
All firm tours are hosted at the firms’ respective offices; the addresses are indicated on the registration page for the event (along with this website).
Registration will begin one week before the date of the event, at 10:00 PM. For example, a firm tour on Wednesday, September 6th 2017 (Regardless of time) will be open for registration on Wednesday, August 30th 2017, at 10:00 PM.
Registration links will be posted in each firm’s corresponding tab below.
To download the CACEE form, click Here .
Cancellations
As demand for these events is extremely high, if you are unable to attend you must cancel your ticket.
Cancellation of a ticket is done latest 48 hours prior to the event directly through the Eventbrite website, under my events, as well as by sending an e-mail to “ alexander.sinora@jmas.ca “.
If you must cancel beyond that point, you will have to contact the firm directly for firms tours and “ alexander.sinora@jmas.ca ” for all seminars as well as any further inquiries.
Black List
As there are limited spots to all the recruitment events, JMAS has put in place a Black List system for the 2017 recruitment period. The Black List system was put in place to ensure that all students get a fair chance to attend as many events as possible. JMAS will be taking attendance at all information seminars this year.  Therefore, if you register for an information seminar but fail to show up or need to cancel your ticket less than 48 hours prior to the event, you will be given one strike. After two strikes, you will be blacklisted from registering to any other firm tours and/or information seminars.
*PwC’s Application Deadline is September 13th 9:00pm*
CACEES are due September 20th 11:59pm
