Readmission

Readmission
Readmission may be restricted or denied to students in poor academic standing.
Assessed: May Not Register without Special Permission
Students who receive this assessment may apply for immediate readmission if there were extenuating circumstances that led to their poor academic standing (illness, death in the family, etc) or apply for automatic readmission after one year. Supporting documentation (doctor's note, death certificate, etc.) must be submitted with the application with an updated transcript. Students will be informed, in writing, of all necessary steps to apply for readmission.
Application
What to do with your Readmission Application:
1- Download the file (either PDF or Word file) and fill it out. Please upload all additional information with the readmission application.  
2- Save it as a PDF.
3- Once you have your LASSI results, also save them as a PDF.
4- Go to your portal in the Student Service Center. On the right hand side, there is a link to “upload a document”. Click on the link.
5- You will need to choose a document to upload. Please select “Arts and Science – Readmission Application”. Follow the instructions to upload the documents – both the application and your LASSI results.
There is no need to submit a paper copy of your application. We will notify you when we have made a decision, over the summer months.
Assessed: May Not Re-register
Students who receive this assessment must wait out at least three years before applying for readmission.
Students in this situation must contact Student Academic Services at extension 2104 and make an appointment with an Academic Counsellor. At this appointment, it will be determined if the student is eligible for readmission. It is only with the Academic Counsellor's permission that a student in the academic situation can apply for readmission.
The deadline to submit the application for readmission is normally June 30th of every year. The exact deadline for the current year is specified on the application. Readmission is not available for the winter or summer session.
