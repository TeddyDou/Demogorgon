Meetings and minutes
Meetings are held approximately once a month from September to May, and, in addition, there are two special meetings each year to approve the lists of graduating students. Agendas and minutes are mailed to all Graduate Program Directors (GPDs), whether or not they are CSGS members. The meetings are open, which is to say non-members who are part of the Concordia community are welcome to attend as guests.
