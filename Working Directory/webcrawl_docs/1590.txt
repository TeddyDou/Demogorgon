Loyola Sustainability Research Centre (LSRC)
The Loyola Sustainability Research Centre (LSRC) integrates the scholarly study of science, policy, and values in the pursuit of environmental and community sustainability.  
Contact us
Since its creation in late 2012, the Centre's thematic focus has been on two of the biggest challenges of our time:
Biodiversity conservation
Climate change mitigation and adaptation
We aim to make a lasting contribution to the transdisciplinary dialogue that is shaping our collective understanding of sustainable futures.
Twenty-six researchers from twelve departments in all three sectors of the Faculty of Arts and Science (sciences, social sciences, and humanities) work together to create a constructive intellectual space, pursue team grants and conduct integrated research, and engage in community outreach activities. 
The Centre is based at the Loyola College for Diversity and Sustainability at Concordia University's Loyola Campus.
