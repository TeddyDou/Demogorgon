Taken from May the Arrogant Not Prevail, 2010, Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago.
Michael Rakowitz is an Iraqi-American artist living and working in Chicago who operates within art spaces and beyond them. In this public lecture, Rakowitz will discuss (g)hosting, a term he uses to explore the intersection of hospitality and hostility in his work, as well as the recuperation of disappeared objects, smells, tastes, customs and relationships through reactivations and surrogates. A survey of his work, Backstroke of the West, curated by Omar Kholeif at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago is on view until March 2018. He is the recipient of the Fourth Plinth commission in London’s Trafalgar Square, where his sculpture, The invisible enemy should not exist will be unveiled next spring. Rakowitz is Professor of Art Theory and Practice at Northwestern University .
His visit to Concordia marks the second annual Wild Talks lecture in honour of Catherine Wild, the former Dean of the Faculty of Fine Arts.
The lecture series is funded by the generosity of Erin Hogg.
