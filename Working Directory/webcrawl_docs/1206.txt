Student initiatives & organizations
There is a wide range of active student initiatives available to you in the Faculty of Fine Arts. Get involved today!
VAV Gallery
Concordia undergraduate students enjoy excellent opportunities to show their work on campus. The VAV Gallery is Concordia’s premier student-run gallery, the only one of its kind at any university or college in Canada. The VAV Gallery programs major shows in all Fine Arts disciplines on a biweekly basis.
Art Matters Festival
Concordia’s student-run Fine Arts festival aims to showcase emerging student artists at off campus venues and galleries throughout the city. The festival, which runs for 2 weeks every March is one of a kind in Canada, organized entirely by students for students. Throughout the year, Art Matters also sponsors workshops, artist talks and parties, and is always on the lookout for students to get involved as board members, temporary staff, volunteers, curators and artists. For more information, please visit the Art Matters website , and keep your eyes peeled for bulletin-board notices in all Fine Arts areas.
Galerie X
Galerie X is a smaller, more intimate gallery housed on the premises of Café X, in the VA Building. To enquire about exhibition opportunities at Galerie X, visit Café X during regular hours of operation, or by calling 514-848-2424 ext. 4241.
J.R. Harper Memorial Reading Room
The Reading Room is a student-run reference facility that provides students with access to a permanent collection of resources on art, art criticism and cultural theory, as well as articles and other materials assigned by Fine Arts instructors to supplement their course curricula. The Reading Room also provides archival services to students and student groups, and offers access to computer workstations, printers and scanners.  Visit the Reading Room
Portfolio
In 2011, the Fine Arts Reading Room launched Portfolio , a website for all Fine Arts students to create profiles that display their artwork in an accessible and professional setting. Portfolio is a free, student-funded online gallery designed so that Concordia undergraduates can display their work to the Concordia community and beyond. To view student work on Portfolio or to sign up for a profile with a Concordia student number, visit the website .
Journals
Several student-run journals are also published:
InArte (Art Education)
Concordia Undergraduate Art History Journal (CUJAH)
Synoptique (Film Studies, Mel Hoppenheim School of Cinema)
