Minor in Sustainability Studies, Loyola College for Diversity and Sustainability
The primary purpose of a Minor in Sustainability Studies is to enable students to complement their Specialization, Major, or Honours program with the systematic development of literacy in sustainability.

Southern Asia Studies, Department of Religion
With a fifth of the world's population, one of the world's oldest civilizations, and an immense political and religious sway, Southern Asia affects our lives every day. When you look at the social and cultural systems of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, or examine religions such as Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism or Jainism, you learn how to relate to the world, an essential education for today’s world.  
To study the customs, social organization, ideas, history and present-day conditions in Southern Asia you must take courses from a range of disciplines: religion, history, political science, film studies, economics, English, and sociology and anthropology.
Our program allows you to focus on your interests. You might connect with your heritage, study an element of contemporary religion or society, or acquaint yourself with an ancient culture. Either way, you’ll leave us with well-developed insights into the art of intercultural dialogue, and expert knowledge of Southern Asia’s important contributions to the world.    
The Department of Religion offers a 42-credit Major and a 24-credit Minor in Southern Asia Studies.
