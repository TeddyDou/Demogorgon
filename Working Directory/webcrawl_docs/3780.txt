It should also be noted that upon passing the Common Final Exam (CFE), students will be exempt from taking the GMAT for MBA admission. In addition, up to 21 credits may be transferred from the CPA program (Courses must have a grade of B- or better) towards the MBA program. This means that to receive an MBA from Concordia you will only require 24 additional credits versus doing the full program, which requires 45 credits!
