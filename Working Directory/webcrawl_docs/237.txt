Shiann Whitebean, 2017 Concordia Valedictorian
"We Concordians push boundaries and exceed limits, but that is how we revolutionize and challenge society.  That is what leaders and innovators do."
A founding member of the Indigenous Directions Leadership Group (IDLG),  Shiann Wahéhshon Whitebean  was one of eight Concordia students chosen to be valedictorian at June Convocation, 2017. Listening to her speech, it is clear that they made the right choice.
