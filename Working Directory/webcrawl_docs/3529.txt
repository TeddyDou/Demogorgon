About the LSA
The Linguistics Student Association (LSA) is open to any and all students that are enrolled in a linguistics class at Concordia. As part of our duties, the LSA is trusted with hosting many events for its students, including: workshops that help develop new skills and further academic careers; meet and greets to familiarize students with the department’s staff and vice-versa; bi-weekly social events, like board game nights and pub socials; and much more! 
We also work to ensure that the voices of our linguistics students are heard and understood! The LSA acts as a liaison between students and the Arts and Science Federation of Associations ( ASFA ), the organization that distributes funding to all student associations within the arts and science department. 
We encourage everyone to contact us with any questions, concerns, or suggestions regarding student life at Concordia.
We want you to get the best out of your experience as a linguistics student!
