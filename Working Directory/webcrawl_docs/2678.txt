Investing in creators

The YouTube Spaces team is focused on helping creators make great content through strategic programs and workshops largely administered at the YouTube Space production facilities in Los Angeles, New York, London, Tokyo, Sao Paulo and Berlin.
As of March 2015, creators filming in YouTube Spaces have produced over 10,000 videos which have generated over 1 billion views and 70+ million hours of watchtime.
Copyright
As of July 2016, YouTube has paid out two billion dollars to rightsholders who have chosen to monetize claims since Content ID first launched in 2007.
As of July 2015, there are 8,000+ partners using Content ID — including many major network broadcasters, movie studios and record labels. They have claimed over 400 million videos, helping them control their content on YouTube and make money on videos containing copyrighted material.
We have more than 50 million active reference files in our Content ID database, making it the most comprehensive in the world. It’s even won a Primetime Emmy!
