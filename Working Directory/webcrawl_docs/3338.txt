Sad to hear about the passing of Tilikum, the orca who was subject of Blackfish at 36 years of age. In the wild male orcas can live to 60 - maybe longer.  I am glad that Tilly’s suffering is over - but there are dozens more like him, emotionally complex mammals held in captivity around the world. Tilikum spent many of his years in B.C. - and in Canada we still have one orca whale, Kiska, and countless dolphins and belugas in captivity.  We are all responsible.  It’s time to #emptythetanks. Tilikum is free at last, I hope he finds his tribe again.
