Mike Paterson, BA 84, is a Montreal-based comedian, writer and actor. As a stand-up comic, Mike regularly tours across Canada and has made over a dozen appearances at the prestigious Just for Laughs comedy festival in Montreal. He has been featured on CTV’s ComedyNow! and has contributed to the popular CBC Radio programs Laugh Out Loud and The Debaters. After performing in English for over 20 years, Mike is now transcending linguistic borders and carving out a name for himself as a bilingual comedian. He was featured on the Videotron Juste pour rire Gala hosted by Mike Ward, and Peter McLeod’s ComediHa! Gala in Quebec City, marking his third televised appearance at the French language comedy festival (formerly Le Festival Grand Rire de Québec). This past year, he was a writer and performer on the wildly popular Mike Ward Show on Teletoon.
Alo Azimov is a stand-up, sketch and character comedian. They are non-binary and delighted to entertain by delivering rapid fire jokes and speaking openly from their heart. Alo performed in Ladyfest this year and last year as part of The Downstairs Mix-up and The Pretty Feminist Comedy Show. They also performed at the third annual Halloween edition of Night Fight, a local live talk show, in Montreal Sketchfest, The Anxiety Show at the Montreal Fringe Festival and The Ladies & Gentlemen Comedy Show at Zoofest & Off JFL. In the same festival, they worked as a stagehand & prop & costumes director for the show Dan Ramos: MontreaL.A. Alo hosts Stand-up Story Slam, a new bi-monthly storytelling show.
Leighland Beckman, BEng 11, started performing in the last year of his software engineering degree at Concordia. He is a regular presence in Montreal comedy shows, host of The Dirty Show, co-host of live talk shows Life Lessons and Night Fight, and has been featured in the Montreal Fringe Festival and OFF-JFL as part of Just for Laughs. His band Aural Turpitude will be releasing a full-length album in 2018 unless they come to their senses.
Kirsten Finch is the official Mistress of Ceremonies for Montreal and Ottawa Comiccons and has performed as part of off-JFL. Child astronauts write about how they want to be Kirsten Finch one day.  
Thomas Leblanc, BA 14, has been called a “gay ginger unicorn” by the very friend who pushed him in the pool of stand-up comedy. He quickly learned to swim and now does laps on the Montreal comedy circuit. With comedienne Tranna Wintour, he co-hosted and co-produced sold-out club shows Sainte Céline: A Dion Cabaret and Crazy Sexy 90’s at OFF JFL/Zoofest Festival, as well as a queer and feminist podcast series titled Chosen Family. A poster boy of Montreal’s franglais crowd, he has worked at Radio-Canada’s ICI Première, Vice Québec and culture monthly Nightlife Magazine). An actor, director, producer, and graduate of Concordia's Communications and Cultural Studies program, Thomas proves that multi-hyphenate Millenials are the best at turning anxiety about the future into cool professional bios.
Walter Lyng, BA 08, has spent the better part of a decade writing for multiple publications, focusing on arts and entertainment reporting, since graduating from Concordia's journalism program. Walter also performs and promotes stand-up comedy in Montreal and elsewhere. In addition, he acts on occasion, co-hosts one of Montreal's top podcasts (Go Plug Yourself) and is an avid professional wrestling enthusiast.
Nancy Webb, MA 15, is a Montreal-based writer and comedian. Her distinct onstage persona has secured her spots at OFF-JFL and Zoofest for the past two years. She recently recorded a half-hour stand-up special with the comedy collective The Brunch Club and co-produces and co-hosts Stand Back: a monthly feminist and LGBTQ comedy show, and Kelp! A Self-Help Hour.
