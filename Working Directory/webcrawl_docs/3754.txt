The world needs more well-rounded marketers and this workshop will teach you how to be one of them. D4M won’t make you a designer - these skills take years to master; but it’ll give you the basics and some great resources to get you on you well on your way. Design workshops will run Saturday and Sunday, and will provide students with design concepts that allow them to create a logo, business card and prepare banners for printers using Illustrator.
