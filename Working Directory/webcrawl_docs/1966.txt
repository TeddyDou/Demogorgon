Political Science (MA)
Master of Arts (MA)
Offered by:
Department of Political Science , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why pursue a Master's in Political Science?
Politics is everywhere. Political thought plays a key role in shaping the world we live in, be it through resource planning, economic structures, public policies, international relations or issues relating to health and the environment. 
The MA in Political Science program offers you the opportunity to address some of the most pressing and difficult challenges facing contemporary politics. Through each area of specialization, you will be encouraged to think about politics and the relations among individuals and political communities from an analytical and critical perspective, including a diversity of epistemological, ontological and methodological viewpoints. 
Engage in sustained and original research which is relevant for professional development within academia, public administration, private industry and NGOs.  You will benefit from faculty-led  inter-institutional and university-wide research centers and research networks , such as the:
Center for Immigration Policy Evaluation
Center for Research and Expertise in Social Gerontology (CREGES)
Centre for the Study of Democratic Citizenship (CSDC)
Concordia University Research Chair in Aging and Public Policy
Groupe de recherche interuniversitaire en philosophie politique de Montréal (GRIPP)
Lab for Latin American and Caribbean Studies , and
Loyola Sustainability Research Center .
Our graduate students focus on many established and emerging subjects, including:
Public / Health / Social Policy;
Security Studies and International Relations;
Diversity / Immigration Studies;
Gender Studies;
History of Political Thought;
Politics of the Global South / Emerging Economies
Program details
