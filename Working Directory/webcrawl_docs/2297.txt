Narrative Bio
Dr. Lucian Turcescu is Professor of Historical Theology and Graduate Program Director. Between 2011-2016 he has served twice as Chair of the Department of Theological Studies. In 2004-5 he was the Chair of the Department of Religious Studies at St. Francis Xavier University (Nova Scotia). He has done research, published, and taught in several areas, including religion and politics, early Christianity, and ecumenism. He received numerous prestigious research grants. He authored, co-authored and (co-)edited several books, most of which benefited from the generous financial support from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada. He published dozens of peer‐reviewed articles. He is twice Past President of the Canadian Society of Patristic Studies (2004‐2008) and an Associate Editor of the Journal of Ecumenical Studies and Theoforum (formerly Eglise et Theologie). He is a member of the Board of the Canadian Centre for Ecumenism, former member of the Board of the Canadian Corporation for Studies in Religion, and the Corporation’s combined program director. In 2010 he received the Concordia University Dean’s Award for Distinguished Scholarship. The award is meant to  “recognize not only the extremely high caliber of research produced over an extended period of time, but also the sheer volume of productivity which has earned the author innumerable awards and grants, and has brought both national and international recognition to the Faculty of Arts and Science of Concordia University.” 
He also serves as Expert Witness in court cases of asylum and deportation, especially connected with religious persecution in Europe.

Teaching activities
2017-18 Courses
In Winter 2018, he will teach:
THEO 206 Introduction to Christian Origins (online, http://www.econcordia.com) 
THEO 333 Jesus Christ in History and Faith (Wed, 4:15-6:30 pm), H-609
This course studies the biblical and later traditions about the person, nature, and work of Jesus Christ, from historical, cultural, social, economic, artistic, and doctrinal perspectives. The course examines the central role of Jesus Christ in ancient, medieval, and contemporary theology and culture. Texts studied include the Bible, theological texts from a variety of historical periods as well as some literary and artistic representations of Christ.
We will be using one of the most highly regarded works of intellectual history, Jesus Through the Centuries,an original and compelling study of the impact of Jesus on cultural, political, social, and economic history. Noted historian and theologian Jaroslav Pelikan reveals how the image of Jesus created by each successive epoch―from rabbi inthe first century to liberator in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries―is a key to understanding the temper and values of that age.
