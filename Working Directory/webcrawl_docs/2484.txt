Carey Price can win the support of the
#
Habs fanbase back by simply playing a few games for the
#
Laval
#
Rocket . Just to show respect to Charlie Lindgren. I'd pay 84 Million just to see that happen.   Because it won't.

Montreal's first female mayor Valérie Plante will be sworn in today and it only took us 375 years. It's a milestone worth acknowledging and celebrating.

How can the
#
Edmonton be so bad offensively after collecting so many top picks over the last 10 years
#
Oilers have about as few goals as the
#
Habs.
#
Montreal has at least the excuse of having drafted in the top 3 only once in the last 37 years.  Waste of
#
NHL talent.

Charlie Lindgren has done everything he can.  This team has completely fallen apart all the while Marc Bergevin looks on and does nothing.
