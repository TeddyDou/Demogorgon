Are you a first or second year accounting student? Have you considered becoming a CPA? Do you wonder what it’s really like to be a CPA? JMAS extends to you the opportunity to shadow a Partner or a Manager for one day at one of Montreal’s top Accounting firms! We have partnered up with the following firms to offer you the chance to spend a day in their shoes: Deloitte, PwC, EY, Richter, PSB Boisjoli & Collins Barrow.
Are you a 3rd or 4th year student who’s always wanted to try their hand at a case competition? Face off agaisnt other students and have the opportunity for your team to win $400 in first place and $200 in second place.
How can you get involved? The John Molson Accounting Society has organized an internal Case Competition where teams of 4 students will be given 3 hours to solve and present solutions to an interesting case! The case will incorporate introductory Accounting theories and strategic management skills. Winners will be announced at our Winter Cocktail networking event where all teams are welcome to participate and network with firm representatives on Wednesday, February 1st 2017.
Ticket Includes:
– Breakfast, Coffee and Lunch
– Entry into the competition
– Admission to “Winter Cocktail” on February 1st, 2017
Details:
– The competition will be done in teams of 4 students. You can sign up as teams or individually. Individual students will be paired up into teams on the day of the competition.
The teams will be divided based on the credits students have completed as such:
1. First Year students (Less than 30 JMSB credits completed)*
2. Second Year Students (Between 30 and 60 JMSB credits completed)*
3. 3rd and 4th Year Students (> 60 JMSB credits completed)**
* Credits completed only from previous semesters, current classes being taken do not count towards the credit total
**Not open to previous JMCC delegates
*** If signing up with people in different categories, team will be placed according to student with highest credit total (e.g. if one team member has more than 60 credits completed while the other ones have 30 or less, your team will be placed in the 3rd and 4th year division).
