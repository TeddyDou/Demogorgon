Why study Finance?
Finance is a competitive program in which you acquire the skills to manage money and practise making decisions that affect the future of corporations, communities and investors. As a Finance student, you will learn to:
Understand the way money appreciates over time
Analyze investment opportunities
Develop financing alternatives
Weigh risk factors to build wealth responsibly
Choosing one of five areas of finance — corporate finance, investments, financial institutions, derivatives, and international finance — you learn through lectures, case studies, simulation exercises and experiential learning. Our Co-op program places you in a financial sector that you want to practise in. Our prestigious Kenneth Woods Portfolio Management Program provides top students the chance to manage a $1.5 million-plus portfolio. You can even develop an academic research project as part of our Honours in Finance program.
Whether you become a commercial banker for a multinational corporation or a consultant with a charitable focus, you’ll leave us motivated to build a sound financial future for any number of clients.
