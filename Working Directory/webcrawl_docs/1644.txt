Sustainable Transportation
As Concordians, we have many of options when it comes to getting to and from the university.
Cycling
November 2016 - Concordia is proud to have received a silver certification from Vélo Quebec's Vélosympathique Certification for our biking facilities on the downtown campus. Check out the list of our facilities below.
Learn more about the Vélosympathique Certification
Cycling is a popular way to get to class and work for many Concordians. Cycling is great for your health, traffic reduction and tackling climate change. At Concordia we are privileged to have access to the city's major bike lanes for both campuses. To support the casual to the avid biker we have several resources available to offer.
Secure Indoor Bike Parking Facility
Protect your bicycle from the elements and from thieves.

Abandoned Bike Procedure and Bike Sweeps
The Abandoned Bike Procedure has been implemented at Concordia to reduce the amount of abandoned bicycles on campus. The Abandoned, Lost, and Forgotten Movable Bicycle Procedure aims to ensure that bicycle parking spaces are available to active cyclists.
Campus bicycle parking facilities are limited and designed for temporary parking of bicycles in active use, and not for long-term storage. Abandoned bicycles reduce the number of parking spaces available to active cyclists and can cause safety, accessibility, and aesthetic issues.
Any bicycle considered to be an Abandoned Bicycle will be impounded in order to maintain adequate, safe, and accessible bicycle parking. All removed bicycles will remain in storage for a period of 90 days, during which time they may be claimed by their owner. Should a bicycle not be claimed within the 90 days allotted, it will be donated or recycled.
Bicycle sweeps will take place approximately three times a year.

IMPORTANT:
If your bike has been tagged or removed,
please visit a Concordia Security Desk or call 514-848-2424, 3717

Biking Resources on Campus
 
Concordia Cycling is an association grouping all the undergraduate cycling enthusiasts of Concordia. The main goal of the club is to provide a safe and friendly environment for weekly organized rides opened to all.
 
Right to Move is a non-profit organization that was started in the spring of 1997 by a group who believed bicycles are a form of transportation that should be available to all, regardless of gender, age, wealth or ethnicity.
Le Petit Vélo Rouge (LPVR) is a collectively run campus and community bike organization in Montreal. The organization was founded in 2010 with the short-term goal of repairing used bicycles for sale to students at Concordia and across Montreal campuses. Our long term goal of the project is to be a community focused bicycle repair shop at the Loyola campus.
The Concordia Library Sustainability Resource Guide is a tool for students, faculty and staff to help explore sutainability research resources. The Guide has links to biking and sustainability book and video recommendations, organizations and other literature material.  
Public Transit
Montreal has one of the finest and affordable public transportation networks in North America - buses, metros and trains link the University to the rest of the metropolitan area, Laval, the West Island and the North and South shores.

Carpooling has many advantages. It allows you to share expenses related to fuel and parking, which leads to significant savings. This way, you do not give up on comfort by radically altering your habits, but do minimize the impacts on the environment and road congestion.
