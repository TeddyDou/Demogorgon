School of Irish Studies
Programs in Irish Studies at Concordia focus on Ireland’s rich history, culture, and the Irish abroad, but their multidisciplinary perspectives also provide students with the opportunity to explore international issues beyond Irish matters. Exploring Ireland as a case study broadens students' educational experience and prepares them for careers in many fields. In combination with other programs of their choice, undergraduate students can take a Major or Minor in Irish Studies , while graduate students have various options for a PhD or MA . All students can receive  generous financial support for tuition  and field trips to Ireland.
