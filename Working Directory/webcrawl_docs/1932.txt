Biotechnology and Genomics (GrDip)
Graduate Diploma (GrDip)
Offered by:
Department of Biology , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why pursue a Graduate Diploma in Biotechnology and Genomics?
Acquire broad-based knowledge of theories, quantitative methods, and applications of genomics, proteomics, molecular genetics, protein biochemistry and bioinformatics.
You’ll engage in in-depth learning about:
functional genomics
microbial biotechnology
production of proteins of value to the pharmaceutical, agri-food and forestry industries
the development of genomic methods for industrial and environmental applications.
The program emphasizes hands-on experience and training with state-of-the-art genomic and biotechnology research equipment. You’ll become proficient in:
real-time quantitative RT-PCR
proteomics (protein extraction, tandem affinity purification mass spectrometry) using a diversity of molecular and bioinformatic tools.
Thanks to small class sizes and experience running your own research project, you’ll have a head start on entering the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, or pursuing further graduate studies.
