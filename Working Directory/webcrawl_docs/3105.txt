Right to Move
Our AGM is on November 21st, Tuesday! You can join us on the 7th floor of the Hall building (1455 de Maisonneuve Ouest) at 6 pm, with the meeting expected to begin at 6.30 pm. Click here for more information.
Right to Move is a non-profit organization that was started in the spring of 1997 by a group who believed bicycles are a form of transportation that should be available to all, regardless of gender, age, wealth or ethnicity.
 
Bicycles are a viable urban transportation option, one far more economical and more ecological than cars in moving people to where they need to be.
 
In order to make bicycling a more accessible transportation option, we:
 
have a drop-in, do-it-yourself bicycle shop where members can fix their own bicycles with the help of volunteer mechanics
hold hands-on workshops series on bicycle maintenance three times per year in english and French
accept and collect bicycles destined for the landfill, fix them and donate them or sell them at low cost to those who would not otherwise be able to afford a bicycle
 
RTM is a membership-based organisation. A mere $20 per year gives you access to our drop-in shop.
 
RTM is a volunteer-driven organisation. We are always looking for new volunteers for our steering committee, to help fix bikes, to be mechanics and to do administrative work. Give us a call, come to the shop (to join and/or to add yourself to the members’ mailing list) and get involved, or send email to RTM/Lvl .
