John Molson School of Business Career Management Services
Employers looking to hire business students for full-time, part-time, internships, and summer career-related positions, can contact John Molson School of Business Career Management Services (CMS).
The CMS can assist you in advertising job postings, and in managing the application process and the collection of resumés, as well as arranging on-campus interviews on your behalf. A variety of services, such as career fairs, expo-days, and information sessions, will increase your exposure on campus.
