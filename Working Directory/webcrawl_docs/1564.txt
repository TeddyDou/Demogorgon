Nearly 150 years ago the Sisters of Charity began construction of the Motherhouse of the Grey Nuns of Montreal. Acquired by Concordia University, this landmark has a new purpose, all the while preserving its outstanding heritage.
Our renovations and restorations have allowed for 355 new student residence beds (for a total of almost 600 residence beds) to help meet the need for quality student housing downtown. The magnificent chapel space has been transformed into a quiet reading room for up to 240 students, another pressing need for our community.
