Conferences are intellectual lifelines – but as a single parent I often miss out
With few academic conferences making an effort to be family-friendly, those of us parenting alone can’t always access the same opportunities as others

“Make sure you actually go this time,” called my head of department as I left the office. “I will,” I yelled back. “I’m actually going to do it.” I was about to go to my first international conference in a decade.
As anyone who travels for work knows, having children adds a layer of complexity to even one night spent away from home. But as a single parent living thousands of miles away from my family, the logistics around professional travel can be especially difficult.
I'm a single parent and a scientist and I'm dangerously stressed

I’d made plans to travel for work in the past, but they’d always fallen through last minute. Sometimes my babysitter had been unwell, sometimes I’d been let down by my son’s father, and sometimes I just didn’t feel I could leave my child for an extended period.
Conferences are an important part of our lives as scholars . They are where we connect with those whose research area is closest to our own, where we receive feedback on work in progress, and where we learn about the latest developments in our fields. Conferences can be intellectual lifelines where we make ourselves and our work visible to potential collaborators and future colleagues.
In Australia, where I live, there is little support to assist with overnight childcare. The situation is similar at most institutions in the UK and the US. A handful of places have support schemes, but even the most generous have limitations and rarely cover the costs involved.
But after a couple of short, successful domestic trips, I felt ready to try going further afield to a conference in the American mid-west. I worked out the minimum amount of time it would take to get there, deal with jet-lag, give my paper, then travel home. I talked the plans through with my son, cleared it with my regular, trusted babysitter, and booked my tickets.
I could, of course, have taken my son with me. But it was term time, and it didn’t seem right to take him out of school. I also remembered an awkward incident at one of my lectures when he was four years old. After diligently colouring in for about 40 minutes, he asked in his loudest, clearest voice: “Have you nearly finished, Mummy? Because this is boring.” He’s older now, but I still didn’t think I could expect him to sit quietly at the back of a seminar room for three days.
During an airport stopover towards the end of my journey, I got a text from the babysitter to say my son has become unwell. I wanted to turn around and go back home. I talked to the babysitter, who told me not to return and that my son would be fine. My son agreed and told me to keep going. So I did.
I am not as visible a scholar as I should be and I’ve had few opportunities to share my work ahead of publication
I boarded the plane for the final part of the journey and worried all the way to my destination. My son spent the next day home from school and – as the sitter predicted – soon recovered. At the conference, I gave my paper and began to relax. I talked to colleagues and re-connected with my academic peer group.
I’m dwelling on this incident quite a bit at the moment, partly because I’m drafting an application for a promotion. The documentation at my institution is extensive, and while academics must argue their case for advancement the process is supposed to be affirming. But as I write I reflect on all the things I haven’t done and all the trips I couldn’t take.
I am not as visible a scholar as I should be and I’ve had few opportunities to share my work ahead of publication over the past few years. I’ve tried to be smart about this – tailoring my research to a more local literature, taking advantage of nearby archives – but there are times when I crave the company and feedback of my immediate peers, and that can only be achieved through travel.
I am fortunate to have a generous fellowship, which came with a large travel stipend. Yet almost all of it will be returned to the funding body when my fellowship comes to an end later this year.
My brief trip to the US left me with a hefty babysitting bill. Such payments are not tax deductible, even though conference travel is regarded as an essential part of career development in many professions. Some institutions offer limited support to enable lone parents to travel, although the sciences seem to have been at the forefront . For humanities, there are a few scholarly conferences that make efforts to be family friendly (pdf), offering childcare or providing spaces for children to play, for example.

One of my senior colleagues, who has dealt with the endless juggling act that comes with single-parenthood, told me that nothing will truly change until those who have experienced such difficulties are in positions of power. That’s a slightly depressing thought, given that the amount of time absorbed by raising a child usually prohibits a rapid rise to the upper echelons.
Meanwhile, I’m planning another trip. I have a whole raft of details to work out, but having done it once, I can do it again. And next time it will be easier, surely.
