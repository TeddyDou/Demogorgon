Dr. James Pfaus
Assistant Professor
Department of Psychology
Dr. James Pfaus
Dr. James Pfaus, Professor in Concordia's Department of Psychology and researcher in the Center for Studies in Behavioral Neurobiology (CSBN), wants to improve your sex life. His research generally deals with the physiological and psychological factors that influence sexual desire and behaviour.
Pfaus and his research team are at the forefront of the next wave of drug development for sexual dysfunctions, working on a drug to treat desire disorders at the level of the brain. He works with laboratory rats (observing their dating and mating behaviour) and human subjects.
His findings not only help companies like Pfizer, Roche, and Palatin Technologies to develop drugs to treat sexual dysfunctions, which help people overcome physical and psychological barriers to a fulfilling sex life, but his research also helps to address the side effects of other drugs such as anti-depressants, and to create therapies that hold promise for treating drug addiction and sexual disorders.
