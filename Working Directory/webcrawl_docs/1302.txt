Why Concordia Library?
We are accessible.
Concordia Library is open 24/7 throughout the academic year — the first and only university library in Quebec to do so.
We are at the centre of the action.
Concordia Library is the one place where all students and faculty go. In 2015 we received 2.3 million visits.
We are experts.
Our subject librarians are knowledgeable in all disciplines to help guide students in their research.
We are connected.
Students can access our services online and chat directly with a librarian.
We support studying.
Our reserve rooms offer students access to all course textbooks. We provide 695 computers and tablets. Last year, Concordia Library had 86,000 laptop loans and 12,500 tablet loans.
We are big.
Our collection includes 1.9 million print and electronic books, 100,676 print and online journals, 129,000 government documents, 3,900 musical scores and 62,000 sound recordings, films and videos.
Next-generation library
Direct your gift to one of the following projects to create the library of tomorrow.
Transform the Vanier Library
The Vanier Library will undergo a major refurbishment including increased group study rooms and student spaces equipped with the latest technology.  .
Open Access Authors Fund
A joint initiative with the university’s Office of Research, the fund supports Concordia researchers who publish a peer-reviewed article in an open access journal that charges author processing fees.
Launch the Concordia University Press
A leader in the open access movement, Concordia Library will launch an open access publishing initiative — the Concordia University Press — one of the first of its kind in North America.
We will publish high-calibre books in the humanities and social sciences, available for free to anyone with an internet connection.
Enhance our collections
Collections are vital to research, teaching and student learning. They are constantly evolving to meet current and future needs.
Advance the libraries’ digital environment
The creation of a Digital Research Centre within the library will facilitate the use and of new technology in research and learning. Additionally, the Technology Sandbox will allow students to experiment, explore and create with new technologies.
