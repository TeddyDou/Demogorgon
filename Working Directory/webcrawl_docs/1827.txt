School location
Located at 2149 Mackay Street, in a charming gray stone building, the School occupies an ideal site for small classes, public lectures, social events, and meetings. School facilities include a common room, a student lounge, a seminar room, a student research room as well as faculty and staff offices.
The building is situated on the east side of Mackay Street, between Sherbrooke Street West and de Maisonneuve Boulevard West. It is steps away from the Hall Building, the main Webster Library Building, and downtown Montreal life with its lively cafés and bookstores. As an older building, the School is not wheelchair accessible.
