Academic Code of Conduct
2015 Academic Code of Conduct
Academic integrity
NOTE that the revised Code (the “2015 Academic Code of Conduct”) will only apply to incidents occurring on or after May 4th , 2015, the first day of the Summer 2015/1 Term.
Students are responsible for being familiar with the rules and regulations concerning graduate registration and with Academic regulations. This information is available in the  Graduate Registration  and  Academic Regulations  sections of the Graduate Calendar.
The deadlines for registering and dropping courses can be found in the  Academic Calendar  section of the Calendar. Students are responsible for meeting these deadlines. If a student has not met these deadlines due to circumstances beyond their control, they may submit a Student Request through their  department .
Graduate Academic Standing
The academic performance of graduate students is monitored on a periodic basis. Academic performance is based on different factors including GPA, C grades, F grades, PhD progress reports. Please note some programs may have more stringent requirements than those listed in the general section of the Graduate Calendar. Please refer to the information in the calendar on  Academic Standing .
The grades for Concordia graduate courses transferred into a graduate program now appear on the student record and transcript and are calculated in the Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA). This helps in addressing the concerns expressed by students that their CGPA does not reflect their actual performance. For further information please contact your program or the School of Graduate Studies.
Academic Code of Conduct
The integrity of University academic life and of the degrees, diplomas and certificates the University confers is dependent upon the honesty and soundness of the instructor-student learning relationship and, in particular, that of the evaluation process. As such, all students are expected to be honest in all of their academic endeavours and relationships with the University.
For further information visit the  Academic Integrity  section or go directly to the  Academic Code of Conduct .
