Welcome to CASAJMSB
On behalf of the Commerce and Administration Students’ Association, it is with immense pleasure that I welcome you to the John Molson School of Business
CASAJMSB is your undergraduate student association at the John Molson School of Business. Our six associations, eight committees and CASA executive team are composed of over 200 student volunteers who organize events and manage services for the students of JMSB.
While the curriculum at JMSB prepares you with the theoretical knowledge to get started in the real world, there is no experience equivalent to getting involved with CASA and its subsidiaries. In my first semesters, I was the student who would schedule all of his classes on one day to minimize the amount of time that I had to spend at school. This all changed after I got involved, where I was purposely spreading my schedule out to spend as much time at school as possible.
Whether this is your first year, last year, or somewhere in between, a big part of making the most out of your time at JMSB will be the commitment that you make to your studies and your involvement with extracurricular activities. I highly encourage you to make 2017 the year that you get involved with CASA or one of its subsidiaries, as it will truly change your university experience.
If you have any questions or concerns about who we are or what we do, our CASA team is always available and eager to hear what you have to say. Please do not hesitate to stop by our office (MB 4.105) or reach out directly to my email address .
On behalf of CASA’s six associations, eight committees, and executive team, I wish you the best of luck in everything you seek to accomplish this year.
