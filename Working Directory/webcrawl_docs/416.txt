Programs
Doctor of/Doctorate in Philosophy (Film and Moving Image Studies)
Master of/Magisteriate in Arts (Film Studies)
Doctor of/Doctorate in Philosophy (Film and Moving Image Studies)
Admission Requirements. Incoming students are expected to have an MA in Film Studies (or cognate field) and a minimumB+ average or GPA of 3.30. Applicants will also be assessed by the School of Cinema’s doctoral program sub-committee on the basis of a writing sample, letters of recommendation, research ability, and a letter of intent outlining research interests, to be submitted with their application. Prior to final acceptance, the student should have identified and contacted a potential supervisor. Final decision regarding supervision will be made by mutual agreement between the student, the doctoral program sub-committee, and the potential supervisor. Feasibility of proposed research and availability of a faculty member to supervise will also be considered. In certain instances students may be asked to complete qualifying graduate coursework. A detailed description of the program may be obtained from the PhD Program Director, Mel Hoppenheim School of Cinema.
Proficiency in English. Applicants whose primary language is not English must demonstrate that their knowledge of English is sufficient to pursue graduate studies in their chosen field. Please refer to the  Graduate Admission page  for further information on the Language Proficiency requirements and exemptions.
Requirements for the Degree
Credits. A fully qualified candidate is required to fulfill 90 credits. The requirements are: 15 credits of coursework, six credits in the form of one comprehensive examination and onespecialization examination essay (three credits each), six credits of thesis proposal, and 63 credits of research and thesis.
Language. While English is the dominant language for activities in the School of Cinema, applicants must demonstrate a level of competence that would allow them to read technical material in French (or another pertinent language with regards to their research). Students may write reports, examinations, and theses in English or French, as they choose.
Examinations and Thesis Proposal. Students must pass a comprehensive exam (three credits), followed by a thesis proposal (six credits), followed by a specialization exam essay (three credits) to be admitted to candidacy.
The written comprehensive examination (three credits) pertains to the candidate’s major subfield of research and is based on a reading list (with an appropriate filmography) prepared by the student with the assistance of his/her supervisor. The reading list and essay are evaluated by an examination committee comprising three faculty members, including the student’s supervisor. The reading list and filmography are first approved by the supervisor and then by the other members of the examination committee, who may suggest further changes. Three to four months after the final approval of the reading list, having indicated his/her readiness to the supervisor, the student receives up to four examination questions from the supervisor, based on the reading list. The student has two weeks to produce an essay answering two of the questions. This exam should be completed by the student no later than December of his/her second year in the program (fourth term).
The thesis proposal (six credits) consists of a 20- to 25-page document outlining the object of study of the thesis, its objectives, the research hypothesis, and the methodology that will be used or developed. A detailed bibliography must accompany the document as well as a preliminary table of contents. The thesis proposal must be defended orally before a jury consisting of the student’s supervisor and two faculty members (the student’s dissertation committee), which ideally is the same as his/her examination committee. The proposal is submitted by the student to the supervisor, and approved by the supervisor no later than April of the student’s second year in the program (fifth term). Upon approval of the proposal, an oral defense is scheduled.
The written specialization examination essay (three credits) is a written case study intended to demonstrate the student’s capacity to perform critical analysis of research material and address the research questions in the thesis proposal. The essay is normally 6000 to 9000 words, following the professional criteria for publication. It is followed by an oral defense before the examination subcommittee. The specialization essay is submitted by the student to the supervisor and his/her examination committee, and is approved for submission no later than December of his/her third year in the program (seventh term). The oral defense is then scheduled for the following January. Upon successful completion of the specialization examination essay (and contingent on the completion of the required 15 course credits), the student is admitted to candidacy.
Research and Thesis. A major portion of the doctoral program is the planning and execution of innovative and original research under the direction of a supervisor. The student’s research will be presented in a written thesis and defended orally in conformity with the regulations outlined in Concordia University’s Graduate Calendar. The candidate will submit his/her doctoral thesis to an examining committee consisting of at least five faculty members: the candidate’s supervisor, two faculty members from the Mel Hoppenheim School of Cinema, a faculty member from another department within Concordia (external-to-program examiner), and an external-to-University faculty member.
Academic Regulations
Academic Standing. Please refer to the  Academic Standing  section of the Calendar for a detailed review of the Academic Regulations.

Master of/Magisteriate in Arts (Film Studies)
Admission Requirements. Incoming students will be expected to have a degree in film studies with a minimum B average (GPA 3.00) in their undergraduate degree. Applicants may be requested to attend an interview with the graduate committee. All applicants will be required to submit an example of their writing on cinema, and a letter of intent.
Some applicants who have undergraduate degrees in other programs will also be considered. These students must have a strong interest in cinema from the perspective of other disciplines such as art history, film production, communications, English, French, sociology, philosophy, history or political science. Students applying from non-film studies programs must demonstrate to the committee that they have a basic knowledge of core film studies materials. Qualified applicants lacking prerequisite courses may be required to take up to 12 undergraduate credits (or the equivalent, to be approved by the Department’s Graduate Studies Committee) in addition to the regular graduate program.
Proficiency in English. Applicants whose primary language is not English must demonstrate that their knowledge of English is sufficient to pursue graduate studies in their chosen field. Please refer to the  Graduate Admission page  for further information on the Language Proficiency requirements and exemptions.
Requirements for the Degree
Credits. A fully qualified candidate is required to complete a minimum of 45 credits.
Language. All students are expected to have a reading knowledge of English and French at the time they begin classes. Courses will be conducted in English, although French texts may be assigned on occasion. Written and oral assignments may be submitted in either English or French. Students who cannot read both French and English texts comfortably should begin their remedial language work before starting classes. A test will be administered by the department to ensure a functioning competency in French for those students whose first language is English or another language. All students must pass this test before receiving their degree, except those who demonstrate to the Graduate Program Director that they are fluently bilingual. A student may also apply to be exempted from the French language test should competency in a language other than English or French be pertinent to the student’s research. This competency must be verified by the GPD.
Courses. The program offers two different options to fulfill degree requirements. All students may take 9 of their required additional course credits in graduate courses offered by other departments in the university. Such courses must be approved by the Department’s Graduate Studies Committee, with permission of the other department concerned. Both program options outlined below require original research.
Academic Regulations
Academic Standing. Please refer to the  Academic Standing  section of the Calendar for a detailed review of the Academic Regulations.
Residence. All options have a minimum residence requirement of three terms of full-time study or the equivalent in part-time study.
Time Limit. Please refer to the Academic Regulation page for further details regarding the Time Limit requirements.
Graduation Requirement. In order to graduate, students must have a cumulative GPA of at least 3.00.
Master of/Magisteriate in Arts With Thesis (Option A)
Candidates are required to take 6 credits in Methods and 3 credits in either Canadian Cinema or Cinéma Québécois, plus 9 additional course credits. They will also take 27 credits of Research and Thesis. The maximum value of practicum (internship) credits allowable in this option is 6.
In admitting students to this option, the Graduate Program Director will ensure that a potential supervisor exists within the faculty for the student’s research area. The onus is on the student, however, to secure a member of the faculty to supervise the thesis. Theses must be submitted to the department at least six weeks prior to the submission deadline given in the graduate calendar. The examination committee will consist of three faculty members, and will be chaired by the Graduate Program Director, who will remain a neutral member of the committee. The GPD may appoint an alternate chair if he or she is a supervisor or reader of the thesis.
Master of/Magisteriate in Arts without Thesis (Option B)
Candidates are required to take 6 credits in Methods and 3 credits in either Canadian or Québécois Cinema, plus 36 additional course credits. In each course, students are required to submit a research paper and make an oral presentation. In this option, students would become familiar with a broad range of methodologies and film practices. Within this framework, they may also be able to pursue specific areas of interest by enroling in independent studies, internships, or taking courses in other departments in the university. The maximum number of practicum (internship) credits allowable in this option is 12.
Practicum Credits
A student may receive credit for work at film institutions (e.g. festivals, archives), periodicals, educational or production establishments and for academic professional internships. Each internship must be approved in advance by the Program Director and the student must consult with an academic supervisor. The duties will be supervised by an individual within the sponsoring organization, in consultation with an academic adviser, to ensure that the student’s responsibilities are in keeping with aims of the MA program. The academic advisor will determine the credit value of each internship, which will be evaluated on the basis of the student’s written report. The report should demonstrate the student’s understanding of the organization’s social and cultural role as well as an analysis of the activities and functioning of the organization. The 3-credit practicum should involve at least 135 hours at the host institution. The 6-credit internship has the same requirements and provisions as the 3-credit internships, except that the student is expected to do twice the work (270 hours). This may occur in a concentrated period of time (one semester), or may be taken over two consecutive semesters.
