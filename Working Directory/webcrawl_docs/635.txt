EHS
Environmental Health and Safety
Environmental Health & Safety (EHS) supports an environmentally responsible, safe and healthy work, research and study environment at Concordia University.
We accomplish this by proactively identifying risks and emerging issues and by developing and implementing innovative, practical and sustainable processes to manage them, including inspections and training.
Through close collaboration with all members of the Concordia community, we establish and maintain health and safety systems that ensure a high level of safety, while not limiting or impeding academic freedom or freedom of research.  
3D Printers on Campus
With the poplularity of 3D printers Environmental Health & Safety (EHS) has created new guidelines for the use of 3D printers on campus  3D Printer Safety Guidelines . This information will also assist you in the selection of the most appropriate printer for your workspace.
All 3D printers on campus must be registered with EHS. You must complete and send the  3D Printer Registration Form  via internal mail to EHS, Loyola - PS-207 or via email to ehs@concordia.ca. Once the registration form is received EHS will conduct a risk assessment review and approve the use of the 3D printer in your area. 
Any questions related to 3D printers please contact Environmental Health & Safety via email at  ehs@concordia.ca  or call 514-848-2424 extension 4877.
