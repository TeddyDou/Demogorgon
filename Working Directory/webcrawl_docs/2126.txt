Teaching English as a Second Language (BEd, Cert)
Bachelor of Education (BEd), Certificate (Cert)
Offered by:
Department of Education , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why study Teaching English as a Second Language?
Share the gift of language and open doors for your students. As a teacher, your passion for people — both young and old — helps them fulfill their potential. When you study Teaching English as a Second Language (TESL), your mastery of teaching the English language gives your students the skills needed to compete in the global marketplace.
With a curriculum that straddles theory and practice, you will have the opportunity to observe experienced teachers and instruct students as a student teacher. You’ll also:
Study the major features of English language sounds
Compare the grammatical structures of other major languages to English and learn to identify typical mistakes made by non-native speakers
Learn teaching techniques aimed at children, adolescents and adults
Students graduate ready to take their place in classrooms in Quebec, across Canada and overseas, and are eligible for certification from the Ministère de l’Éducation et de l’Enseignement supérieur .
