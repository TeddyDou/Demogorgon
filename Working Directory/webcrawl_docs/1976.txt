Sociology (MA)
Master of Arts (MA)
Offered by:
Department of Sociology & Anthropology , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why pursue a Master's in Sociology?
Design and conduct a study that addresses a pressing contemporary social problem. Develop a deeper understand of various cultural and cross-cultural practices and differences that impact individuals on personal, local and global levels.
The MA in Sociology provides a critical and politically engaged research setting where you will develop advanced training in a wide variety of sociological methods and theories. Course materials and resources enable students to skillfully explore traditional topics in sociology, while also offering opportunities to consider new and emerging areas of social inquiry.
Our faculty members have connections to multiple research centres , such as the Centre for the Interdisciplinary Study of Culture and Society, Centre for Broadcasting and Journalism Studies, Centre for Technoculture and Games (TAG), and the newly launched  Milieux Institute for Arts, Culture and Technology . Well-known for encouraging students to participate in local, national and international research projects, our faculty also includes Quebec’s first-ever  Research Chair on Gambling .
Program Details
Program options & degree requirements
You may choose one of two options.
Option A: MA in Sociology with Thesis
Option B: MA in Sociology without Thesis
Students enrolled in option A are required to demonstrate their ability to carry out independent research. A thesis proposal serves as the basis for the elaboration of the written thesis.
Option B is a year-long program that asks students to write a research essay under the supervision of a faculty member. Essays are evaluated by two faculty members, including the supervisor, and can be either a literature review or a report on empirical research.
Requirements for the Degree
Credits. A fully-qualified candidate is required to complete a minimum of 45 credits. Additional courses may be taken from outside the program, subject to the advice and approval of the student’s supervisor or the Graduate Program Director.
Supervision. At the beginning of the first term of full-time or part-time study, the student is assigned an interim advisor for the duration of the first term. At the beginning of the second term in the case of full-time study, or the equivalent in terms of part-time study, the student must select a permanent thesis supervisor and a second faculty member to serve on the Thesis Committee. Members of the Thesis Committee evaluate the thesis. The thesis will be examined by an Examining Committee, composed of the thesis supervisor and the second committee member, and a third faculty member chosen in consultation with the Graduate Program Director. The responsibility for the composition of the Thesis Committee rests with the student in consultation with and subject to the approval of the Graduate Program Director.
Language Requirement. A working knowledge of English and French is recommended although written work may be submitted in either language.
 
Consult the graduate calendar for full degree requirements.
