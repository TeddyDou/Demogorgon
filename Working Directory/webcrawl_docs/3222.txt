Club Description: 
The Concordia Egyptian Student Association (CESA) was revived in the 2003-2004 academic year. In addition to uniting students with Egyptian origins and connecting them to their roots, the association has actively aimed to strengthen its mission of fostering Egyptian history and culture to all Concordians.
In its first year on campus, CESA made a strong impact by giving birth to Concordia's first and only Egyptian newsletter, Om el Donya.
By being nonaligned, both religiously and politically, CESA attracts members from a diverse student body. CESA has appealed to over 300 students, who today make an impressive membership that continues to grow.
In 2014, CESA held its largest human rights event at the Concordia Hall building auditorium. The highlight of the event was Norman Finkelstein who shared knowledge about the human rights situation in both Gaza and Egypt. The event was attended by over 350 people.
The CESA is dedicated to uniting the Concordia Egyptians undergraduate students on social and human rights basis.
