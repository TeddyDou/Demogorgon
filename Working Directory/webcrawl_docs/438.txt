Graduate application deadlines
The deadline to submit your application varies by program. Some programs also require you to submit other documents too, at the same time (for example, a portfolio or a writing sample).
Deadline dates are subject to change without prior notice. Priority will be given to applications submitted on time. In some cases, programs may continue to accept applications after the deadline has passed; please check with the Graduate Program Assistant or Coordinator .
International students: submit your application and all supporting documents as early as you can, to allow yourself enough time to obtain the immigration documents you will need to come to Canada.
