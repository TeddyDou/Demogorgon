Program
Doctor of/Doctorate in Philosophy (Humanities)
Doctor of/Doctorate in Philosophy (Humanities)
The Humanities PhD program, in the Centre for Interdisciplinary Studies in Society and Culture (CISSC), is an interdisciplinary doctoral program jointly offered by the Faculty of Arts and Science and the Faculty of Fine Arts. Humanities students pursue original interdisciplinary doctoral projects of research or research-creation (which combines creative practice with scholarly investigation) under the supervision of an advisory committee. This committee is composed of three faculty members chosen from departments that correspond to the three fields informing the student’s interdisciplinary project. A Humanities student’s Faculty designation (Arts and Science or Fine Arts) is determined by the Faculty affiliation of their major field supervisor.
Admission Requirements. The normal requirement is a Master of Arts or Master of Fine Arts with high standing from a recognized university. The Humanities Program Committee reviews the applicant’s academic background, portfolio (for research-creation applicants), and research or research-creation proposal in order to determine whether a) the applicant's project is truly interdisciplinary and falls within the scope of available faculty and facilities at Concordia, and b) the applicant’srecord indicates that they are likely to excel in a demanding program that requires rigorous engagement in more than one discipline.
Proficiency in English. Applicants whose primary language is not English must demonstrate that their knowledge of English is sufficient to pursue graduate studies in their chosen field. Please refer to the  Graduate Admission page  for further information on the Language Proficiency requirements and exemptions.
Requirements for the Degree
Fields of Study. Students in the Humanities PhD program identify the three fields that inform their interdisciplinary project: a major field and two minor fields. A “field” is defined as a recognizable and coherent segment of a discipline, and in some instances may itself be interdisciplinary.
Advisory Committee. Prior to admission into the program, applicants form an advisory committee composed of three faculty members – a major field supervisor and two minor field advisors – chosen from faculty members in departments that correspond to the three fields informing the student’s interdisciplinary project. In consultation with the student, the advisory committee determines the student’s program of study. Where the need for access to such resources as equipment, materials, or space arises for applicants seeking to pursue research-creation projects, they must discuss such needs with their prospective supervisor at the time of application.
Credits. A fully-qualified candidate is required to complete a minimum of 90 credits. These are apportioned as follows: minimum course requirements, 18credits; three comprehensive field examinations, each examination worth 3 credits; thesis proposal (with defence), 6 credits; thesis, 57 credits.
Courses. Students are required to take two 3-credit core seminars in their first year: HUMA 888 and HUMA 889. The remaining 12 elective course credits are chosen in consultation with the student’s advisory committee. The following may be used as elective courses: graduate courses at the 600 level or higher offered by departments in areas relevant to the student’s program of study; 3-credit directed study courses; may also include HUMA 887 (Special Topic). A directed study course provides students with the opportunity to pursue advanced and focused work with individual faculty members in the fields that constitute the students' program of study. Directed study courses (3 credits) are designated HUMA 884 followed by the course topic.
Comprehensive Examinations (HUMA 891, 892, 893). Upon completion of the required coursework, students take three comprehensive field examinations before proceeding to the thesis proposal stage. Each examination is set and marked by the student’s advisor in that field. For students pursuing a research-creation project, one of the comprehensive examinations is a studio examination attended by all three advisors and chaired by the program director. The three comprehensive field examinations are designated:
HUMA 891 Comprehensive Examination Major Field (3 credits)
HUMA 892 Comprehensive Examination Minor Field I (3 credits)
HUMA 893 Comprehensive Examination Minor Field II (3 credits)
Thesis Proposal with Defence (HUMA 894). Upon completion of the required coursework and three comprehensive field examinations, students are admitted to candidacy following acceptance by their advisory committee of the written thesis proposal and its successful oral defence. The thesis proposal should be integrative in character, bringing the student’s three fields to bear on the thesis project and laying the groundwork for the thesis.
Thesis (HUMA 895). A doctoral thesis should be based on extensive research in primary sources, make a significant and original contribution to knowledge, and be presented in a manner that conceptually and formally accords with scholarly standards. Students may produce a research-creation thesis with the approval of the student’s advisory committee and the Humanities Program Director. In accordance with the thesis guidelines of the School of Graduate Studies, a research-creation thesis normally comprises two synthesized components: a creative production component (which may be presented in a variety of media, communicative, or performative platforms) and a written scholarly component. The written scholarly component of the research-creation thesis should demonstrate substantial knowledge of the relevant scholarly literature, consider methodological issues, and present a contribution to knowledge. In addition, the research-creation thesis must demonstrate knowledge of prevailing practices and precedents in the practical field of activity in which the creative production component situates itself, and may reflect on the production process.
Language Requirement. Prior to submission of their thesis, doctoral candidates are required to demonstrate an ability to read and translate scholarly material in at least one language (other than the language of their thesis) relevant to their studies.
Academic Regulations
Academic Standing. Please refer to the  Academic Standing  section of the Calendar for a detailed review of the Academic Regulations.
Residence. The minimum residence requirement is two years (6 terms) of full-time study, or the equivalent in part-time study.
Time Limit. Please refer to the Academic Regulation page for further details regarding the Time Limit requirements.
Graduation Requirement. In order to graduate, students must have a cumulative GPA of at least 3.00.
 
Required Courses

This course engages with theories and methods of interdisciplinarity germane to the humanities, social sciences and fine arts, including those pertinent to research-creation. Its objectives include enhancing awareness of the role of conceptual frameworks and institutional practices in the shaping of interdisciplinary scholarly and creative explorations, and providing students with opportunities to begin pursuing theoretical and methodological issues vital to their individual interdisciplinary projects.
HUMA 889 Seminar in Interdisciplinary Studies II (3 credits)
A required core seminar to be taken by all students within their first year in the program. Each year a different topic or approach is selected with the aim of exploring how it is pursued and challenged across disciplinary boundaries.
Elective Courses

This seminar examines in-depth special topics in interdisciplinary studies.
