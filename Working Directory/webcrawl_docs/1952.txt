Exercise Science (MSc)
Master of Science (MSc)
Offered by:
Department of Exercise Science , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why pursue a Master's in Exercise Science?
Research in Exercise Science is booming. Researchers in the department are asking important fundamental and clinical questions, from how the body produces new muscle proteins to face challenges to how stress can influence the cardiovascular system. In continuation with the strengths of our undergraduate programs, our research agenda is strong in basic mechanistic sciences to understand how the body works, in the clinical areas of injury prevention and care, and in the chronic care of certain diseases through exercise.
Our MSc program emphasizes research. There are few courses and all courses focus on research. For an overview of the program, please download our  presentation on the MSc in Exercise Science at Concordia .
Program details
Degree requirements
Requirements for the Degree
Credits. A fully qualified candidate is required to complete a minimum of 45 credits.
Courses. Students must complete four 3-credit courses (EXCI 610, 612, 624, 626).
Thesis. (EXCI 680 or EXCI 690 - 33 credits). Students must select either the Athletic Therapy (EXCI 680) or Clinical Exercise Physiology (EXCI 690) Thesis track. Students must present their thesis proposal before their thesis advisory committee, and the proposal must be approved by the committee before research activity is initiated. An oral examination will be conducted before a committee of the department to test the student’s ability to defend the thesis. A formal presentation of the thesis to the students’ peers is also required.
Admission requirements
Admission Requirements. The admission requirement is a BSc or equivalent degree in Exercise Science or related field of study. Applicants are selected on the basis of past academic record, letters of recommendation and relevance of proposed research to the expertise of the department. Enrolment in the Master’s program is limited in part by the availability of research supervisors.
If a core deficiency exists in the student’s previous undergraduate background, otherwise qualified candidates may be required to take up to 12 undergraduate credits.
There are no prerequisite certification requirements for Clinical Exercise Physiology. Students applying for the Athletic Therapy option should have or be preparing to acquire CATA certification. While not required, CATA certification is an asset for acceptance into the program.
Proficiency in English. Applicants whose primary language is not English must demonstrate that their knowledge of English is sufficient to pursue graduate studies in their chosen field. Please refer to the  Graduate Admission page  for further information on the Language Proficiency requirements and exemptions.
Application process
Your completed application will include:
Application form and Fee
Curriculum Vitae (CV)
One  Letter of Reference and  Academic Assessment form  
Exercise Science Entrance Form
Transcripts  for all post-secondary institutions attended
Proof of Canadian citizenship (if applicable)
Applicants whose primary language is not English, are required to submit official language test scores , unless exempted.
Please apply  online . Read the  how-to guide  for application procedures.

Course descriptions
EXCI 610 Statistics and Research Design (3 credits)
This course provides students with a background in statistics and experimental design. Students are exposed to a variety of experimental designs applicable to the exercise sciences. The course covers the application of statistical concepts in consideration of specific experimental design methods. A number of parametric and non-parametric statistics are introduced for hypothesis testing, with the opportunity to apply relevant knowledge using various statistical software packages.
EXCI 612 Laboratory Techniques (3 credits)
The course provides a theoretical awareness of measurement principles and offers practical experience in applying techniques common to advanced research methodologies in exercise science. The potential topics to be covered are geared towards the requirements of the individual in the areas of exercise physiology and athletic therapy. These may include such topics as data acquisition and analysis, electromyography, blood flow methodologies, spectrophotometry, pulmonary gas exchange, motion analysis, and tissue histochemistry.
EXCI 624 Special Topics Seminar (3 credits)
This course is designed to meet the special needs of graduate students in the exercise science areas of concentration specific to athletic therapy and clinical exercise physiology. Topics vary within the domain to account for investigation of current and developing theories. The course involves presentation, discussion, and critical analysis of information from current scientific journal literature.
EXCI 626 Thesis Proposal (3 credits)
This course provides students with the opportunity to choose a research topic and formulate a research proposal under the supervision of a thesis advisor. The proposal should include a literature review, rationale, hypothesis, and methodology including the planned research design and data analysis. Students are required to present a seminar in the Department on their research prior to the presentation of their proposal to the thesis advisory committee.
EXCI 680 Thesis (Athletic Therapy) (33 credits)
Students are required to demonstrate their ability to carry out independent research which reflects a scientific approach. The thesis will be examined by the students advisory committee before being accepted by the Department. In addition, an oral examination will be conducted before a committee of the department to test the students ability to defend the thesis.
EXCI 690 Thesis (Clinical Exercise Physiology) (33 credits)
Students are required to demonstrate their ability to carry out independent research which reflects a scientific approach. The thesis will be examined by the students advisory committee before being accepted by the Department. In addition, an oral examination will be conducted before a committee of the department to test the students ability to defend the thesis.
EXCI 698 Selected Topics in Exercise Science (3 credits)
This course explores themes within the area of Exercise Science.

Funding
The Department of Exercise Science is pleased to offer outstanding candidates financial support through a variety of awards and scholarships. All applicants are automatically considered for funding and do not need to submit applications for these awards. Some examples of awards offered are:
Faculty of Arts and Science Graduate Fellowships, which vary in value and provide 2-years of funding.
Concordia Merit Scholarships, valued at $10,000 and paid over 1-year.
Out-of-Province Fee Remissions (Masters). This award carries a value of $6,000.00 over 4 terms, and is open to newly admitted, Canadian students in a Master's research program paying out-of-province fees. *Students paying the Quebec or international tuition rates are not eligible for this award
Prospective students are also encouraged to apply for external fellowships with the Social Sciences & Humanities Research Council , Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada , or Canadian Institutes of Health Research depending on the field of interest.  Successful applicants who begin receiving full external fellowships/scholarships from a designated granting agency when starting their degree program at Concordia are offered a prestigious Special Entrance Award from Concordia during the first year of tenure of their External Award. 
Please consult Concordia’s  graduate funding  and  Financial Aid and Awards for additional details.
