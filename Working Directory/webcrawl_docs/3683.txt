The Committee
As a start up committee co-founded by Jonathan Addessky and Stephanie Beauchamp, the JMBLC is an initiative undertaken by motivated John Molson School of Business students with the goal of filling the gap between Law and Business as we strive to bring knowledge and information about both disciplines to the students of John Molson.
