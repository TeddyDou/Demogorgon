Either the Flames have no defensive gameplan or their gameplan is to give up as many Grade A chances as possible in which case they're killing it

Never really made sense that a guy with this much talent was such a below average finisher.  Nate MacKinnon now on pace for 30 goals, 95 points, and shooting 13.5%

Crazy thought here but maybe it's the other players, who aren't as good as the best player, who are actually to blame https://twitter.com/sportsnet/status/932024679170297856 …

McPhee says Shipachyov simply wasn't good enough. Was the worst Center on the team, and didn't want to work on his game in the AHL.

Good thing there aren't a lot of good hockey players in Russia so VGK completely bungling this situation won't have any further consequences.

Everyone always talks about how NHL teams are using more detailed in-house metrics but honestly just having a basic understanding of shooting percentage and how it works would be a good start for most of them

So simple, yet so good.   From 2010-2016 Eberle averaged ~27 goals per season and shot just north of 14%.   Had one unlucky season.   Annnnd he's on pace for exactly that again this year. pic.twitter.com/F5aLOxaKk5

The only issue with watching as many Blue Jackets games as I have this year is having NHLtv default to their feed when they're at home. Can't switch fast enough.
