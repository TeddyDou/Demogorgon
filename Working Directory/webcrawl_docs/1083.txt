Management
The Master of Science (MSc) in Management is designed for students who wish to enhance their research expertise in the areas of human resources and strategic management. The curriculum focuses on developing knowledge about current management theories and skills in the tools and methods used to conduct advanced research in an organizational setting. The structure of the program allows candidates to produce the kind of research that is becoming increasingly necessary in contemporary organizations or lead toward advanced graduate studies.
The MSc in Management prepares students for various careers. For those who wish to pursue a career in business or other organizations, the program prepares graduates to assume staff or analyst positions in human resources, change management, and strategic planning, or to work as consultants. The program also serves as an excellent stepping stone for those wishing to pursue doctoral studies in management or industrial and organizational psychology.

MSCA 645   Organizational Theory and Design   (3.0 credits)
Offered by: Management
Program: MSc
This course is a research-oriented seminar, in which we will explore a number of different theoretical perspectives on organizations and organizational environments. The primary aim of the seminar is to introduce students to an understanding of how organizational scholars have conceptualized and studied organizations as social systems and how these social systems interact with and are embedded in the context of an external environment. Particular attention is given to how organizations can be understood, both internally and in relation to the environment, as social structures composed of relationships, interdependencies, and social-cultural institutions. At the end of the seminar, students would have acquired a sophisticated understanding of the social and social cognitive context through which behaviour by people in organizations is both facilitated and constrained.
