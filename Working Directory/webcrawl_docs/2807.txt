It's #StarWars Star Wars Day! (The Empire Strikes Back, Return Of The Jedi, Star Wars: The Phantom Menace, Star Wars Episode 2, Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, Star Wars: The Clone Wars, Star Wars: The Force Awakens Fans, Star Wars: The Last Jedi) we here at The DAMNews want to use this day to bring a message to the people. We must become educated about how our country's #economics work. #MMT is. We do not need to raise #taxes or cut #spending to fund anything. If we learn the truth. If we become educated. There is nothing we can not do. #ItsInOurHands to bring the masses to this revolution!
Animation, Story, and Production by Kat McHugh

Revenge of the 5th! #StarWarsDay #RevengeOfThe5th
https://blog.adafruit.com/2017/05/05/revenge-of-the-5th-starwarsday-revengeofthe5th/
The Jedi must end ‚Äî and not in a Luke-finally-figures-out-what-balance-means kind of way, but in an Order 66 kind of way. Sometimes it feels good to be bad.
Check out the cosplay and project below that give glory to the dark side of the force!
See list here!

Star Wars Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band #StarWarsDay #StarWars
https://blog.adafruit.com/2017/05/05/star-wars-sgt-peppers-lonely-hearts-club-band-starwarsday-starwars/
A group with the unlikely name of Pallette-Swap Ninja has created what can only be called a geek singularity: a Beatles/Star Wars mashup that tells the story of Star Wars as a cover of the seminal album Sgt. Pepper‚Äôs Lonely Hearts Club Band.
It‚Äôs got titles like ‚ÄúWith Illicit Help from Your Friends‚Äù and ‚ÄúBeing from the Spaceport of Mos Eisley‚Äù, this is the sort of thing that could give the right kind of nerd a grin for days.
From Pallette-Swap Ninja:
‚ÄúWe sweat the details on both sides in an effort to do both cultural milestones justice. Writing hyper-specific lyrics that match the original songs‚Äô cadences; reverse-engineering everything the Beatles recorded, from distorted saxophone riffs to Indian tabla rhythms; recording everything from scratch and learning as we went ‚Äî well, that‚Äôs what takes five years.‚Äù
From slashfilm:
If you love this as much as I do, the good news is that there are more ways to listen to the entirety of Princess Leia‚Äôs Stolen Death Star Plansthan just watching on YouTube. If you head over to Palette-Swap Ninja‚Äôs website, you can download the entire album for free in both as both 320kbps MP3 and FLAC formats.
