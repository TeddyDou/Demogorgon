CONCORDIA SHUFFLE
Our community's annual walkathon — from Sir George Williams Campus to Loyola Campus — raises funds to support our students.
Shufflers brought in a record-breaking $104,000 this year! 
Shuffle marks the launch of Concordia’s annual  Community Campaign , which bolsters student life, teaching and research at our university.
 
Since 1990, Shufflers have raised nearly $1.4 million. More than 800 graduate and undergraduate students have benefited from Shuffle-funded awards, and the number grows each year.
