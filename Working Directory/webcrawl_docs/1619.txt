Quebec permanent code
Identify yourself as a Quebec student
You will pay more tuition if you do not have a permanent code.
Quebec's Ministère de l’Éducation et de l’Enseignement supérieur  (MEES) gives you a permanent code to identify you as a student in the Quebec education system. Universities need your permanent code to receive funds to help pay for your education.
Register or apply for a permanent code now
Provide Concordia with your existing permanent code – or give us the information needed to create a permanent code – and we will forward your information to the ministry. All you need to do is to  visit MyConcordia.ca and fill out the Permanent Code Data Form . ( How to apply for your permanent code )
Log into MyConcordia.ca
On the left-hand side, under "MyConcordia Menu," choose "My Student Centre."
Under the "Personal Information" section, select "Code Permanent Data Form."
