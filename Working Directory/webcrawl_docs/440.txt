Concordia University Senate Resolution on Open Access
Open Access at Concordia
Spectrum, Concordia University's open access research repository, provides access to and preserves research created at Concordia. By depositing in Spectrum, Concordia scholars provide free and immediate access to their work and thus increase the visibility of both their own research and their university's intellectual output. Open access leads to the increased research profile and impact of scholars by bringing about greater levels of readership and citation of their publications.
For more information, see " Concordia  opens access to its research output " in the Concordia Journal.
Find out more about Open Access and the Open Access Author Fund on the Library's website.
