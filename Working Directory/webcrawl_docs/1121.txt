Admissions
In general, to be considered for admission you must have achieved the level of secondary education required to apply for university studies in your home province, state or country. John Molson School of Business undergraduate programs have additional admissions requirements beyond the minimum criteria required for admission to general university studies. Please see below for these requirements.
The standard advice for all applicants, regardless of their situation, is to make use of all three program choices found in the online admissions application.
Please indicate your preferred JMSB program as your first choice (BComm, BAdmin, etc.), and then indicate a second and third backup program offered by another faculty at the university. The recommended backup program to JMSB is the Certificate in Arts & Science; however, no one program is more advantageous than any other when transferring internally to JMSB from other Concordia university programs.
Admission requirements
Applicants from Quebec Cegeps
Pre-university (Two-year)
Cegep applicants completing a two-year pre-university Diplôme d’études collégiales (DEC) must achieve a minimum overall CRC of 26.00 and an average CRC of 25.50 in mathematics. The mathematics courses considered for admission are Calculus 1 and Linear Algebra only.
Applicants are eligible for admission to JMSB once they have completed at least one of these two mathematics courses, provided the other course is completed at JMSB during the first year. However, it is recommended that applicants complete as many of the JMSB prerequisite courses as possible within their Cegep program (see Potential Course Exemptions).
Professional/technical (Three-year)
Cegep applicants completing a three-year technical DEC in a business-related field may also be eligible for admission without the mathematics profile specified above, provided they achieve a minimum overall CRC of 26.00 and achieve a minimum of 75% in the quantitative business course(s) required for their Cegep program. It is also recommended that these applicants submit their high school transcripts with their application. If admitted, applicants will be required to complete all missing prerequisite courses as elective credits at JMSB (see Potential Course Exemptions).
Note: three-year technical DEC students who have chosen to complete Calculus I and/or Linear Algebra mathematics courses must achieve an average of CRC of 25.50 in mathematics.
Potential Course Exemptions
Once applicants are admitted based on their overall CRC score and average CRC in mathematics, admitted students may be awarded course exemptions in the following Cegep courses:
Minimum grade required
Course
75% grade
Math 201–103 or 201–NYA (Concordia: MATH 209)
75% grade
Math 201–105 or 201–NYC (Concordia: MATH 208)
75% grade
Intro to Macroeconomics (Concordia: ECON 203)
75% grade
Intro to Microeconomics (Concordia: ECON 201)
Pass grade
Computer Literacy  (Concordia: BTM 200)
Admitted students who do not receive exemptions for these courses in their letter of acceptance will be required to complete them as elective credits at JMSB during their first year in the program. These prerequisite courses will count for credit and will not normally prolong a JMSB degree in any way.
Applicants from Canadian high schools
Applicants must be completing grade 12 in Canada with a minimum overall average of 80% and an average of 80% in mathematics in the required number of senior-level grade 12 courses.
All applicants must have completed the required mathematics and English courses (or French if they attended a French-language school) and must meet the requirements to graduate in their home province or territory:

Applicants from United States high schools
Applicants must be completing grade 12 with a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 (on a 4.30 scale) and an average GPA of 3.0 in mathematics courses. Final grade 11 and mid-term grade 12 results are used to calculate admissions averages.
Advanced Placement (AP) courses will only be assessed once the applicant’s file is complete. SAT or ACT scores are not required for admission; admissions is based solely on high school grades. A GED is not accepted in lieu of a high school diploma.
Applicants with United Kingdom A Levels
Applicants must have completed at least three O levels with an overall average of B, including a B in mathematics, as well as at least two A levels with an overall average of C, including a C in mathematics. Two AS levels may be considered equivalent to one A level, unless otherwise stated.
Applicants from the International Baccalaureate Program
Applicants from the International Baccalaureate (IB) diploma program must achieve an overall predicted score of 28 points as well as a predicted grade of 5/7 in standard level (SL) mathematics
A  test of English proficiency  may also be required.
* Applicants who have completed higher level (HL) mathematics may be eligible for course exemptions upon admission, though not advanced credit.
Applicants from the Baccalauréat Français program
Applicants must have completed the Baccalauréat with an overall score of 13/20 and an average score of 13/20 in mathematics courses, on their first attempt.
Applicants are assessed on their academic performance in the three trimesters of Première and first trimester of Terminale.
A  test of English proficiency  may also be required.
* Applicants who have completed série économique et sociale (ES) option mathematiques or série scientifique (S) mathematics may be eligible for course exemptions upon admission, though not advanced credit.
Applicants from other international high schools
Applicants from countries and education systems not specified above are generally admissible if they meet the academic and English-language proficiency requirements for admission to Concordia University, provided they achieve above-average grades overall and in pre-university mathematics courses in their home country. This would translate roughly to a 3.00 CGPA (on a 4.30 scale) or the equivalent of a "B" grade at Concordia University.
In most cases, final grade 11 and mid-term grade 12 results are used to calculate admissions averages. A  test of English proficiency  may also be required.
Applicants to the Mature-entry option
Admission as a mature student may be granted to Canadian Citizens or Permanent Residents, subject to the following conditions:
Applicants must have reached the age of 21 by August 1 or December 1 of a given year, to enter the University in the following September or January, respectively.
Applicants must demonstrate that they have the potential to successfully undertake undergraduate courses, as they do not meet the normal academic requirements for admission: the Quebec Diplôme d’études collégiales (DEC), or equivalent.
Applicants must have been out of full-time academic study for at least 24 months in total since reaching the age of 18. Applicants who have been out of school for only 12 months are also admissible, provided that they have had no unfavourable academic record in the previous 24 months.
It is recommended that mature-entry applicants submit a résumé and a letter of intent.
Applicants must have 5 years of relevant business work experience, or have completed the following prerequisite courses, or their equivalent, with a B- average overall and in MATH 208 and 209 specifically:
MATH 208 (Fundamentals of Mathematics I)
MATH 209 (Fundamentals of Mathematics II)
ECON 201 (Introduction to Microeconomics)
ECON 203 (Introduction to Macroeconomics)
BTM 200 (Fundamentals of Information Technology)
A  test of English proficiency  may also be required.
Transfer applicants from other universities
Applicants from other universities who wish to transfer an unfinished degree or complete a second degree at the John Molson School of Business must have achieved a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 (on a 4.30 scale) with an average GPA of 3.0 (B equivalent) in mathematics courses. Ideally, applicants should have completed all prerequisite courses (Calculus I, Linear Algebra, Microeconomics, Macroeconomics and Computer Literacy).
Applicants who meet the minimum entry requirements but lack some or all of the prerequisite courses are encouraged to apply and may still be considered for admission, providing they have completed business or business-related courses.
A  test of English proficiency  may also be required.
Newly admitted applicants will likely receive credit for university-level courses completed at a recognized institution, subject to  Concordia University policy . Transfer credits will only be assessed once the applicant’s file is complete and an admissions decision has been made. Details and an explanation of all transfer credits will be included in JMSB acceptance letters.
Note: per university policy, completed university courses must have an equivalent grade of "C-" or higher to be transfered for credit to a JMSB program.
*Additional conditions may apply for university transfers. Applicants in Failed Standing are subject to additional requirements.
