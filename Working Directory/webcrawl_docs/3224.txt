Club Description: 
Revived in 2016 in name, logo and constitution, The Egyptian Student Assocation of Concordia is excited to get back into the Concordia scene, and engage all undergraduate students in our extensive Egyptian Culture and History! Through the organization of social events and activities, we are looking to protray Egypt in a positive scope and remain apolitical and areligious in our path which we hope to embark on during our educational experience at Concordia University. We are aiming to showcase cultural, historical, and social elements such as food, games, guest-speakers, trips, movie screenings and etc., to help provide students with a surplus of opportunities to get an insightful taste of Egypt, and get a real life, first hand experience exeucted by our eager and motivated Executive Team! We are hoping to push through and engage all students in our associations' upcoming and exciting events! Remember, you don't have to be Egyptian to experience the Egyptian Culture!
