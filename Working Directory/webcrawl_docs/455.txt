How does it work?
Look up the current buyback price
Search for the buyback price below for your textbooks by entering in the ISBN number (generally you can find a book's ISBN number on the back of the book, or on the inside cover, example: 978-0-32168650-3)
Get price
Or come see us and inquire at the information counter at any of our locations
Sign up to be notified by email when we will be buying back your books.
Once you have a price quote bring your textbooks to the SGW Campus Book Stop Boutique, or the Loyola Campus Book Stop to sell them back!
Don't forget to bring your student ID!
We will verify the buyback prices for your textbooks and give you your money on the spot!
The best time to see used textbooks
The time that you choose to sell your used books is important. The best time to sell your used books is near the beginning of a term and the first 2 weeks after the beginning of classes (especially in August / September, December / January, and April), those times of the year are when the best bid prices are typically available.
How is the buyback price determined?
1. Home priceup to 50% of the current new price
If the book is going to be used again in an upcoming Concordia course, and if we haven't already purchased the number of copies required for the upcoming term, we will give you up to 50% of the current new price in cash.
2. Away priceup to 30% of the current new price
If the book is being bought by another campus bookstore in Canada, you will receive up to 30% of the current new book price (much of the difference form our price is for shipping / handling to send books across country).
3. Wholesale priceno fixed percentage
If no demand for the book exists at any campus bookstore, we cannot buy it. The last buyers are US book wholesalers. Unlike the academic stores, they do not offer a fixed percentage of  the new price, but set theirs bids according to the demand they 'guesstimate' for each title. Therefore, when a title is not widely used this will result in a very low bid price for your book.
What can I do if I find the price offered too low?
Buyback alert
If the book has not yet been adopted on any campus, you can register online here and list the textbooks you want to sell. We will automatically notify you by email when a school wants to buy your books.
Free bookstore classifieds
You can try to sell books directly to other students with our used book classifieds. This free service is available here . Concordia Stores does not get involved in these transactions, they are privates sales.
