Pick up your student ID card
Your student identification card confirms that you are a Concordia University student. You will use it for all kinds of essential everyday campus activities, from using the library and printing documents via DPrint, to riding the shuttle bus, and writing exams. For these reasons, please carry your student ID card with you at all times.
Obtain your ID in two steps
Register for your courses. Wait at least 24 hours before coming to Birks to pick up your ID card.
Come to the  Birks Student Service Centre . Simply bring your
Photo ID (e.g., driver’s license, medical insurance card, passport)
Student ID number (You will find this on your acceptance letter, class schedule or student record)
Initial student ID cards cost $11.50, which will be charged to your student account. Should you need a replacement card, a $15 charge will apply.
