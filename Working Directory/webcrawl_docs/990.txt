Gazette journalists and Concordia researchers
launch a citizen-engagement experiment
Concordia University , The Montreal Gazette and the 2016-2017 Atkinson Fellow on Public Policy are partnering in a first-of-its-kind experiment to explore the gap left by shrinking newsrooms and determine whether it could be filled by inviting experts and citizens to work together to tackle  a question of civic importance.
WE WANT YOUR INPUT
This project is dynamic and ongoing so new elements will be rolled out over the coming weeks and months. Whether it's submitted as an individual or a community organization, we need your input on what it takes to build the Montreal of the future: Participate through online events to be hosted on Concordia or Montreal Gazette social media accounts. Watch this space for updates.

Whether it’s about  maintaining a bridge on a budget  or  saving money – and lives – with ‘smart’ construction  Concordia researchers are tackling infrastructure and roadwork from a variety of angles.
Explore their work below.
 
The vision of 2016-17 Atkinson Fellow Catherine Wallace
The Atkinson Fellowship in Public Policy
On Saturday, October 4, Wallace published the following articles in the Toronto Star:
Atkinson Fellowship: The missing ink

Projects
Mazdak Nik-Bakht, Assistant Professor in the Department of Building, Civil, and Environmental Engineering
Gathering hard data from social media posts
Prof. Nik-Bakht and his research team have developed an innovative method that could allow the powers behind mega-construction projects to better inform citizens on the scope and objectives of roadwork, as well as its impact on commuters.

Amin Hammad, a professor in Concordia's Institute for Information Systems Engineering
4D video simulation of construction projects
Prof. Hammad also believes Montrealers could be better informed about how the work on complex infrastructure projects will be carried out and what impact that work will have on people using the roadways. The twist? The fouth dimension is time.

Video illustration of proposed Turcot overhaul
A few years ago, Prof. Pierre Gauthier, an urban planner in the Faculty of Arts and Science, and his undergraduate research team partnered with Prof. Hammad and his research team to illustrate an alternative proposal for the redesign of the Turcot.
