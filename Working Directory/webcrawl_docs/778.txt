MACHINES – Montreal premiere with the director!
November 27, 2017, 7 p.m. – 9 p.m.
Join Cinema Politica for the Montreal premiere of Machines - an intensely evocative and hypnotic representation of textile factory workers in India’s Gujarat region and a deeply political message for worker's rights. Director Rahul Jain will be in attendance!
Admission is by donation ($5-10 suggested). The venue is wheelchair accessible.
MACHINES
Rahul Jain / India - Germany - Finland / 2016 / 75' / Hindi /
S.T. English
Exhausted labourers in a gigantic textile factory in Gujarat, India, are trapped in an oppressive cycle of poverty. A roving camera captures their harrowing experience deep in the factory’s surreal bowels, a disorienting and labyrinthine series of corridors of rusted machinery.
A visceral journey, Machines is composed of striking, wordless sequences and intimate exchanges with the workers, who remain stoic in the face of their difficult conditions. Some have travelled from afar to support their families and cling to their jobs despite low wages and unreasonable 12-hour shifts. Some even work double shifts, with just an hour in between to eat or nap. With so few options available, they’re stuck with the hardship of slave-like work, their plight illuminating the dehumanizing impact of rapid and unregulated industrialization and pointing to larger shifts in Western India and the world.
