THE POLICY AND POLITICS OF REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT IN CANADA
How does the Canadian state respond to refugees?
July 24 – August 4, 2017
Since November 2015, Canada has welcomed over 40,000 Syrian refugees .
The Canadian approach when it comes to immigration and refugee policy is generating a lot of international attention from researchers, governments and advocates. 
This graduate summer school,  a collaboration between the School of Community and Public Affairs and the Department of Political Science , responds to a growing appetite for a better understanding of the Canadian Syrian refugee initiative.
Participants learn about the policies, state institutions and private initiatives that characterize Canada’s approach to refugee resettlement and, also acquire knowledge about the political dynamics supporting refugee resettlement.
