Religion (BA)
Bachelor of Arts (BA)
Offered by:
Department of Religions and Cultures , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why study Religions and Cultures?
People’s religious beliefs and cultural orientations touch on the most fundamental aspects of human existence: health, illness and death; sexuality; gender roles; power dynamics; social relationships; and the search for meaning. In an increasingly interconnected world, the ability to fully respect and understand the religious and cultural realities of others is powerful indeed. By developing an informed appreciation of different cultures and values, you’ll position yourself to engage with the world as a truly global citizen – and gain insight into your own assumptions, as an individual and a member of a group. If you consider yourself a social activist, the programs in Religions and Cultures may be the place for you!
The study of religion at Concordia is characterized by a deep respect for diversity of culture, gender, and sexual orientation and by an emphasis on field work. You’ll have the opportunity to visit places of worship and meet people connected to Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism in Montreal.  You will have the opportunity to study languages spoken across the world.
