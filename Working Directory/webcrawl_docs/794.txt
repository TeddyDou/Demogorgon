Book Launch: Everyday Sacred: Religion in Contemporary Quebec
November 29, 2017, 5:30 p.m. – 7 p.m.
Book launch: 'Everyday Sacred: Religion in Contemporary Quebec, edited by Hillary Kael (Department of Religions and Cultures)
 
Over the last decade there has been ongoing discussion about the place of religion in Québécois society. The essays in Everyday Sacred emerged from this active and often tense period of debate. They offer clear and varied case studies about how people encounter, create, and employ religion in everyday life : rural Catholic roadside crosses, indigenous drumming circles, urban African Pentecostal adolescence, Muslim feminism, Iraqi Jewish cooking, new forms of alternative healing in Montreal, transhumanist online networks.
Everyday Sacred is the first English-language volume about contemporary Quebecois religion. It is long overdue. Its clear, readable case studies may interest a broad audience and are especially useful for undergraduate and CEGEP students. They are the ones who can and should be smarter citizens vis-a-vis religion. Multireligious universities like Concordia are just the place to bring such issues to the fore.
The volume's main themes include: religious and secular identity, pluralism, the bodily and material aspects of religion, the impact of gender on community and the public sphere, and the rise of hybridity, sociality, and new technologies in transnational and online networks.
With authors Frédéric Parent, Hillary Kaell, Elysia Guzik, Géraldine Mossière, Norma Joseph and Laurent Jérôme.
