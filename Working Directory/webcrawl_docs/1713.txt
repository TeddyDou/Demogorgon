PLANNED GIVING
Shape future generations of students; shape your future.
A planned gift allows you to make a meaningful gesture that is tailored to both your financial and charitable goals. 
Make a more significant contribution than you thought possible; through planned gifts you can achieve financial and tax benefits that help fulfill your philanthropic goals.
Your gift can be tailored to fit your interests. Choose from more than 500 areas to support — from athletics and libraries to physical resources and research.
We'll find immediate and deferred tax advantages for both you and your heirs and suggest meaningful ways your support of Concordia can meet goals and interests beyond your own lifetime and far into the future.
