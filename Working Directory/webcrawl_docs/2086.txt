Environmental Science (BSc)
Bachelor of Science (BSc)
Offered by:
Department of Geography, Planning & Environment , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why study Environmental Science?
Tackle some of the most important issues we face today: climate change, natural resource management and sustainability. Examine the endangerment of species, natural systems and the effect of pollution. As an Environmental Science student, you’ll follow a path where geography, geology, biology, chemistry, computer science and engineering intersect.
Through labs, lectures and projects, you’ll learn to assess the impact of human activity on natural cycles and landforms. You can choose to apply your skills during an internship or field research. You’ll also:
Study the causes and consequences of environmental change
Learn to gather and interpret statistical data
Acquire technical knowledge of computerized mapping and Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
Learn to develop effective and efficient policies for environmental management
Choose to specialize in Ecology, Hydrosphere or Geoscience
After graduation, your knowledge and technical skills will prepare you for a career in research.
Program Details
Degree options
A Bachelor of Science degree takes a minimum of three or four years (90 – 120 credits) of full-time study,  depending on your academic background .
Concentrations
Honours in Environmental Science (69 credits)
Specialization in Environmental Science (69 credits)
