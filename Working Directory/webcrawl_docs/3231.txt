Club Description: 
Jack.org Concordia is where student leaders get to work on the ground. We want to create a sustained, year-round noise for mental health in our university. We hope to engage everyone in the conversation on mental health through loud, positive, and fun initiatives.
Jack.org Concordia, as a registered club of both the CSU, serves to partake in raising awareness about mental health services available on and off campus.
Our initiatives will aim to promote at least one of the following among students at our school:   
A belief that mental health is relevant to them; that they’re part of the 5 in 5  *
An increase in comfort/willingness to talk about mental health   
An understanding of the importance in caring for themselves, and the knowledge of how   
An understanding of the importance in caring for their peers, and the knowledge of how   
An awareness of campus/school/community mental health resources. 
 
*1 in 5 Canadians will personally experience a mental illness in their lifetime.  As well, 5 in 5 of us have mental health and we all need to care for it.
