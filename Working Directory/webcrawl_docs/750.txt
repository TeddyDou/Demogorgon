Sacred Sites Visit: A Bahá'í Shrine
November 23, 2017, 3 p.m. – 5 p.m.
Come join the MFSC as we lead a visit to the only Bahá'í Shrine in Canada.
Learn about this young world religion through a guided tour of the shrine, which will be followed by tea and a short documentary.
Following the visit, we will make our way back to the Multi-Faith centre for Mother Hubbard's $2 vegan dinner.
