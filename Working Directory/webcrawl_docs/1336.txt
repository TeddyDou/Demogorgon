How to get a Library Privilege Card
While the Concordia University Library is open to the public during regular service hours , members of the external community need a Library Privilege Card in order to borrow items.
To obtain a Library Privilege Card, the user must bring the documents required for their user group to the Circulation Desk at either the Vanier Library or the Webster Library during service hours.
Research and reference assistance is offered on a priority basis to Concordia's primary constituency, that is, currently enrolled Concordia University students, faculty and staff. Reference assistance is provided to other users as time permits.
All persons using the library must respect the Library Code of Conduct .
