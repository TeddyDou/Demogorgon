Animatic to Rough Animation
Here I have edited together different versions of the same scene from my previous post. Even after the story is decided, there are so many ways to tell that story. This is why animatics are crucial for a smooth production, so that these changes can be made earlier rather than later. 
The first change was the composition of the first few shots. As mentioned before, the pan in the first version is unnecessary, and actually creates more confusion than it does clarify Rose’s emotions. There are a variety of different techniques to help focus your audience’s eye on specific elements, a pan being one, but a close-up and a cut to a wider shot serves this scene better. This way, we see the whole scene and not bit by bit, which allowed me to show Rose’s reaction more directly. 
In the same way, adding in close ups of the Rose’s face as she grabs the petal shows her emotion, rather than relying on the sigh to communicate all of it. Adding a variety to sequences of shots from close ups to farther shots creates more dynamism and keeps it interesting. For this particular film, I rarely use far away shots because of the intimacy of the story. We are always emotionally close to the characters. As well, a child’s world is rather like a tight-knit community, especially for a character like Rose who is still very naive and young. As they learn, their world expands along with their knowledge. 
The last change was to the action itself, where Rose is now humming the wedding march as she holds her flowers. This was more of a happy coincidence rather than a deliberate change, which is all part of the fun, too. When I began to animate this scene, I had Rose holding the bouquet with both hands and it felt robotic. I laughed to myself thinking, “It’s like she’s walking down the aisle.” And click, the idea came. Of course a child would pretend to be getting married as she holds a bouquet of flowers. Why couldn’t I think of that sooner? It added charm to the scene, and it made Rose more believably child-like. It wasn’t a subtle change, but it didn’t require more work (and was actually more fun to animate), and it kept the shot to relatively the same amount of time. Win-win.
