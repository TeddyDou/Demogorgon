‘Blue Met is about pushing boundaries’
APRIL 24-30: Here’s your Concordia guide to Montreal’s multilingual literary festival
Posted on April 7, 2017
|
By: Cecilia Keating
Graphic Storytelling with Matthew Forsythe is just one of the many events at the upcoming festival.
Concordia professors, students and experts pepper the lineup of this year’s Blue Metropolis literary festival, which takes place across Montreal from April 24 to 30.
Members of the Creative Writing Program are hosting poetry readings; Matthew Forsythe , Mordecai Richler writer-in-residence, is giving a talk about graphic storytelling; PhD candidate William Robinson will perform the works of celebrated auteur game designers; and Nathan Brown , assistant professor of English from the Faculty of Arts and Science , is hosting a poetry panel discussion.
Concordia’s Technoculture, Art and Games (TAG) interdisciplinary centre for research collaborated with the festival to create an event series focused on video games and how they influence narrative.
The Concordia Effect
The university’s faculty and students have participated in each edition of Blue Metropolis since its genesis 18 years ago, and this year they’re playing a larger role than ever. A new event series called “ The Concordia Effect ” groups together many of the events listed above and more.
Jason Camlot , associate professor of English and associate dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science, spearheaded Concordia’s involvement with the festival this year.
“It’s an opportunity to show the larger community that Concordia is a place where literature is created, discussed and researched, in all its diversity.”
Camlot is one-eighth of the English-language programming committee for the festival. He says the diversity of Concordia’s faculty and students makes it a great fit.
“Like Concordia, Blue Met is about pushing boundaries and offering innovative programming.”
This year’s festival is spotlighting Slovenian literature, but it also features an event series dedicated to Spanish and Portuguese writing. While the majority of the programming is in French and English, 22 per cent of the events are either bilingual or in other languages.  
Blue Metropolis was the world’s first multilingual literary festival and the 2017 edition includes more than 250 events across Montreal, including several on Concordia’s Sir George Williams Campus.
