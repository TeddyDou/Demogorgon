Published on Oct 18, 2017
We began our work as the C-FAR (Critical Feminist and Activism) Project in September 2016 by asking our community, what is your vision of an inclusive university? What does it look like? Who has access? What services are available? What kinds of conversations and dialogue take place in an inclusive university? What are the priorities and values of an inclusive university? What kinds of change fosters an inclusive university?
The visions shared with us, in this video and across our campus and communities, have oriented our work as a community-building, research and training initiative emerging from an intersectional feminist framework anchored in anti-racist and anti-oppressive approaches to equity, inclusion and representation.
But we are still asking, what is your vision of an inclusive university? This is an ongoing conversation and one that requires everyone’s insight, especially those whose voices, desires, needs and aspirations have been and still are underrepresented. If you’d like to your share your vision with us, please visit our project at http://www.cfarconcordia.com or reach us at http://www.cfar@concordia.ca .
