Instructional Technology (GrDip)
Graduate Diploma (GrDip)
Offered by:
Department of Education , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why pursue a Graduate Diploma in Instructional Technology?
The Graduate Diploma programme in Instructional Technology prepares you for careers as designers and developers of instructional materials, and as professionals who implement technology in educational settings.
While preparing for these roles, you learn how to assess and identify the needs driving requests for instructional materials and technology in education; design and implement instructional programs and other types of solutions, and evaluate the outcomes of these programs.  These aspects represent what instructional technology is, a field that facilitates learning and improving performance by creating, using, and managing appropriate technological processes and resources.
Course-related projects that emerge from partnerships established by our faculty  with local, national and international start-ups, NGOs, corporations, schools, colleges, CEGEPS, and universities provide opportunities to link classroom learning with its application in the real world. We offer an optional “field experience” to provide you with an opportunity to apply skills developed in the program in a work situation, as you launch your career in the field.
The program teaches you to:
Analyze organizational contexts to identify underlying opportunities to improve individual and organizational performance through instructional (training) and non-instructional interventions (such as incentive systems, management, workplace design).
Prepare individual instructional programs for maximum effectiveness with the intended learners, achieving the desired outcomes, and addressing the practical challenges in learning situations.
Create a performance improvement campaign or curriculum that links several related instructional programs and other resources to achieve a complex goal while taking a systemic approach to developing competence among learners.
Apply sound learning theories and results of educational research to solve performance problems and guide instructional design.
Develop competence with the technologies used to create and deliver instructional and educational materials online, learning materials for classes, workbooks and multimedia materials.
Appropriately choose technologies for instructional and educational purposes.
Evaluate learning programs and educational materials.
Lead instructional projects and educational technology groups.
Conduct research that leads to further developments in the field.
