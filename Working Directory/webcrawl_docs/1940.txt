Economics (GrDip)
Graduate Diploma (GrDip)
Offered by:
Department of Economics , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why pursue a Graduate Diploma in Economics?
Economists recognize that in order to guide today’s policy makers and business leaders, an advanced knowledge of economic applications and policies is required. Now more than ever, we need critical minds with a broad foundation in the field of economics to study the trade-offs between growth and pollution, public and private medical services, and many other pressing issues that affect our daily lives. 
The Graduate Diploma in Economics provides an academically rich learning environment where you will develop a basic understanding of macroeconomic, microeconomic, and econometric theories and methods. Course materials and resources are designed for students who want to pursue their studies at more advanced academic levels and for working professionals interested in economics as a secondary field.
In addition to numerous theoretical and applied research interests in economics, our professors are engaged in various multidisciplinary projects, contributing to publications in statistics, sociology, and medical research, as well as in government policy reports and media opinion pieces.
