I've added the Fibres Dept room and technician schedules for 2011 on the website.  I know having them online will be helpful for me, I hope you'll find it helpful too.
You can find them under the 'for members' part of the website.

FSA Meeting notes
Fun(d)raising
Ideas:
       Pop up Beauty Salon, similar to hair cutting fundraiser last year,
nails, makeup?
Stitch Your Heart Out, triangle scarf emphasis this year, assistance
with getting down basic stitches and moving on to a simple project
***Really excellent fundraising would raise money and promote the
fibres department, should we move to the VA, MB to spread the
word/make connections?
Concordia Grants:
FASA Special Projects Grant: Deadline Oct 6th? What would we like to
use those funds for?
Concordia Committee for Student Life (CCSL) grants- up to 500$
