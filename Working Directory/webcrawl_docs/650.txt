Let's get patching - Time to update your wireless devices!
Posted on October 31, 2017
Phones, laptops, tablets, smart watches and many more devices are the target of a new widespread IT vulnerability.
Dubbed the “ KRACK hack ”, the widely used ‘Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2)’ encryption protocol, which is relied on by most users to keep their web use protected, has been compromised.
This flaw allows hackers to decrypt and possibly view everything you’re doing online – this includes the possible theft of your personal information including passwords, personal photos, emails and other sensitive data.
Users should be cautious when using Wi-Fi until patches have been rolled out by manufacturers and installed on all devices. Patches are already available from several major tech companies such as Google, Microsoft, Cisco, Intel and Apple.
To protect the Concordia community, IITS has ensured that patches are being deployed to all centrally managed computers and infrastructure but users will still need to install patches on their personal devices.
What to do?
- Install all available security patches on your personal wireless devices as soon as they become available.
- Not sure if a security patch is available? Contact the manufacturer to find out when patches are being released.
- Patch not available yet? Consider using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to encrypt all web traffic.
If you require any assistance or believe your computer has been compromised please contact the IITS Service Desk immediately at ext. 7613 or help@concordia.ca .
