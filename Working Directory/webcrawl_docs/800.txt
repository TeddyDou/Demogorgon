Team Work and Real-World Projects: What role does the professor play?
November 30, 2017, 12 p.m. – 2 p.m.
In project based courses, where students work directly with external partners to meet a deliverable, it seems obvious that the learning experience changes considerably, but what about the teaching experience? Many models of this pedagogical approach exist, ranging from professors who are very hands-on to others who prefer to give their student free reign. Using two courses as a point of departure, this Living Knowledge session will consider the role professors play in facilitating these real-world learning opportunities.
How can a professor ensure that their students have the communication, team work and other skills they need to meet their partners’ expectations? On the other side of the equation, what level of support do professors need to provide to the partners themselves?
Recognizing there is an extra workload in these courses as compared to a more standard lecture-based class, we will collectively explore the challenges and benefits of teaching in this way. How can the additional tasks required by real-world projects be incorporated in a sustainable way? Are there tools and templates that can facilitate these processes?
Guests:
Meral Demirbağ Büyükkurt is a Professor in the Supply Chain and Business Technology Department and Director of Assessment and Accreditation at John Molson School of Business. She teaches a course in systems analysis in which students form teams that work with real businesses over the entire semester. In thirty years of perfecting this course, over 150 businesses and organizations have participated as clients. The course’s continued relevance and usefulness to students is fueled by Meral’s dedication to experiential learning and empowering students to develop skills that they can take with them directly into their careers beyond the classroom. She has given seminars and workshops on this topic at academic conferences and through Concordia’s Centre for Teaching and Learning.
Steven Henle has used experiential education as a framework in many courses over the previous 13 years. By providing an authentic learning opportunity, students are hands-on and minds-on to provide a quality program to community partners. When students are placed into a professional role they become engaged in deep-learning. Steven has been on faculty in Applied Human Sciences for fourteen years. In addition Steven provides teacher training workshops for CEGEP and university professors on group work, student motivation, facilitation, and course design.
This is the second of four meetings of Living Knowledge events during the 2017-2018 academic year. Living Knowledge strives to bring together faculty and staff who share a passion for community engaged scholarship, with the goal of creating connections, sharing ideas and strengthening our collective practice. Students, community organizers and representatives from other universities are also welcome. For more information, please email livingknowledge@concordia.ca or follow this link to RSVP .
