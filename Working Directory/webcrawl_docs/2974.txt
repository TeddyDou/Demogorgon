Rent Receipts

Did you know that it is your right under the Civil Code of Quebec to recieve a reciept for each payment of rent you make to your landlord?
The HOJO always recommends you exercise this right to ensure you have proof of payment for your rent. Even if you pay by bank card or transfer still ask your landlord for a reciept. If they do not have a way of offering you one then you can use this generator to create your own.

Remember if you don't have proof you paid it's like you never did. Landlords can and do take advantage of tenants this way. Know your rights so that you can better protect yourself.
