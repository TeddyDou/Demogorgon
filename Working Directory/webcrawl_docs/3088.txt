Welcome back, Concordia students!
Looking for a way to get involved in your community? Come help out at the People's Potato! We welcome walk-in volunteers anytime from 9am to 3pm, every weekday. So come help peel some potatoes, wash a couple dishes, or on the serving line!

The People's Potato is a collectively-run soup kitchen that offers vegan meals to students and community members on a by-donation basis. No one is turned away for lack of funds.
We serve lunch during the fall and winter semesters from Monday to Friday between 12:30 and 2pm (except during statutory and school holidays). We are located at 1455 de Maisonneuve West on the 7th floor of Concordia University's Hall building.
