Horizon Postdoctoral Fellowships
In recognition of the significant role that Postdoctoral Fellows play in our research enterprise, Concordia University administers two Horizon Postdoctoral Fellowship Competitions per year. The Horizon Fellows program is a key component of the Double our Research strategic direction and brings a fresh cohort of exceptional young researchers who challenge our faculty, mentor the next generation of researchers, and boost our research and creative productivity. Our Horizon Fellows work in state-of-the-art facilities and centres with top researchers, while advancing their own development as future research leaders in all sectors.
We fund 24 to 30 two-year fellowships per year in a range of disciplines where supervisors have demonstrated a link to our  Strategic Research Plan . A call for applications is released based on projects selected in a highly competitive process.
