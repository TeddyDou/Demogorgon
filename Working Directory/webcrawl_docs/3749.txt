Meet our Team
Introducing 15 crazy, dedicated and excited students who all share one main passion: marketing. We're Curious. We're Ready. Are you?
The Executive Team
The 2016-2017 team couldn't be more excited to be able to represent JMMA. Over the summer we worked hard toward making this year at JMSB even more colourful. We're introducing three new events, a new line of entertainment, called JMMA Shorts, and revamping our social media platforms to better engage with students.
