Who Are The People Behind JMSM?
JMSM consists of 19 undergraduate students from different fields of study at the John Molson School of Business who share a passion for business and sports. We strive to provide students with the best sports business conference in the country.
“There is a breed of people out there, unlike the rest. Those who watch sports and look for something more. They want the game to mean something. They want it to matter. Every game offers a blank canvas, whose artists paint with sweat, and blood. It is chaos; controlled, and the relentless pursuit of progress. Of perfection. It is the burden of expectation, and the pain of unkept promises. It is competition, in its purest form. A city, united. A nation, captivated. More than sticks, and bats, and rackets, but instruments. Each shot, each swing, etching a legacy into the fabric of history. It is being remembered. For better, or for worse. There are no scripts, no formulas. Success can’t always be attributed, but it must be recognized. Every stride, pushing the boundaries of human achievement. Sport is alive. Living, breathing, and ever changing. It is in all of us. Every cheer, every tear, is a promise. A promise to those that do more than see, but believe. A promise to you. A promise to all of us. Maybe it is “just a game.” Or maybe, it’s something more.”
Our Vision
As the largest student-run sports business conference in Canada, we commit to creating the greatest sports business conference experience in the country. We will continue providing our delegates with tangible educational experiences as well as both practical and technical competencies enabling them to succeed in their future endeavours.
