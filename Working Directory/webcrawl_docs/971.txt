Summer Session
Returning Students — Students enrolled in a BEd Specialization in TESL or Certificate in TESL program must meet with their academic adviser in order to register for any TESL course offered in the Summer Session. All other students in the Faculty of Arts & Science do not require academic advising prior to registering for summer courses.
General information
Course Prerequisites
The registration system will not permit you to register for a course which has a prerequisite if you have not completed that prerequisite. If a course has “permission of the Department” as a prerequisite, you must obtain authorization from the appropriate department in order to register for the course.
Course Entry Restrictions
Many courses in the Faculty of Arts & Science are reserved in whole or in part to students enrolled in specific programs and are not available as elective courses.
Course Overloads
Full-time students who wish to take a course overload (i.e. more than 12 credits) in the Summer Session must receive permission from their academic adviser or from Student Academic Services in the Faculty of Arts & Science. The normal Fall/Winter course load for full-time students is 15 credits per term.
Students are advised that they must have completed at least 24 credits and have a cumulative GPA of 3.00 or above before attempting to undertake a course overload in any session.
General Education Requirement
Newly admitted students to the Faculty of Arts & Science are required to satisfy the General Education requirement. For more information regarding this degree requirement students may contact the academic advisor in their Department, or the academic counsellor in Student Academic Services (extension 2104). Detailed information may also be obtained by consulting Section 31.004 of the Undergraduate Calendar for the year in which you were admitted to a program in Arts and Science.
