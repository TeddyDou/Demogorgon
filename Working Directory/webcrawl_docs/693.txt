WORKSHOP – Learn how to understand, recognize, and prevent radicalization leading to violence
November 20, 2017, 8:30 a.m. – 12 p.m.
The Centre for the Prevention of Radicalization Leading to Violence (CPRLV) is offering a free training session ‘Learn how to understand, recognize, and prevent radicalization leading to violence.’ 
This training session is addressed to front-line workers (social workers, case workers, youth workers, doctors, psychologists, community workers, teachers, street workers, etc), including current Concordia employees.
This 3.5-hour training session is lead by CPRLV’s professional team and is a great opportunity for front-line workers to learn more about violent radicalization and its prevention, with the following objectives:

Recognize the different types of behavioural, cognitive, or emotional changes displayed by vulnerable or radicalized individuals
Identify risk and protective factors associated with radicalization leading to violence
Determine appropriate strategies to respond effectively to situations of radicalization leading to violence
