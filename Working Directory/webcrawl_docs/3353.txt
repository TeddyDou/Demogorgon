Policies and procedures:
Make a request of reservation via the Reservation Request e-form or directly with the technician.
Wait for the confirmation from the technician.
Go to the EV security desk and ask for the KEY# of the individual studio you reserved rather than the room#. If you're not on a key access list, make arrangement with the technician.
At  the end of your shift return the key to the EV security desk. Never  pass the key to the next person yourself. The transfer of keys and  responsibility belongs to the EV security desk.
It is forbidden to keep a key over days.
