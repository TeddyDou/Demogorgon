Child care centres
Concordia offers services to both student parents, faculty and staff. We have two daycares on our campuses and a resource centre for student parents.
Financial assistance for child care expenses is available for eligible students through the Quebec Financial Aid/Loans and Bursaries program and through the Ministère de la Famille et de l'enfance.
