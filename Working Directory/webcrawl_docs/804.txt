Yvette Perreault: Resiliency in HIV/AIDS Community Organizing
November 30, 2017, 7 p.m. – 9 p.m.
What's Lost? What's Left? What's Possible? Resiliency in the Early Years of HIV/AIDS Community Organizing
In celebration of World AIDS Day, we are happy to welcome Yvette Perreault (Executive Director, AIDS Bereavement and Resiliency Program of Ontario), who will be offering a first-person experience of working in the AIDS trenches in the 80s & early 90s.
Perrault's narrative reflects a particular time of community organizing in an unpopular, stigmatized battle for social recognition, government response, and improved medical care for people with AIDS. As the context has shifted to a focus on HIV in a North American context, the battle metaphor has changed to one of quality of life, resilience and thriving. This journey has included coming to terms with the impact of ongoing multiple losses, disenfranchised grief and community devastation. Perreault will explore some of those hard-won aspects of community health whole-person well-being.
DON'T MISS: Workshop with Yvette Perrault (Dec. 1 at noon)
Perreault will also be leading an interactive workshop on December 1 at noon, exploring loss and resilience tools developed to sustain activism within our communities.
This limited-registration event will prioritize staff/members of HIV/AIDS community organizations and students in related fields.
Please email  hivaids@concordia.ca  to reserve your place.
