How do I upload documents to my application? Can I submit additional documents after the deadline or after my application has been submitted?

Log in to your MyConcordia Portal at MyConcordia.ca  
Click the "My Student Centre" link (on the left-hand side)
See the “To Do List” (on the right-hand side)
Use the “upload document” button at the bottom of the To do list.
Consult the step-by-step guide for uploading documents.

Log in to your MyConcordia Portal at myconcordia.ca  
Click the "My Student Centre" link (on the left-hand side)
See the “To Do List” (on the right-hand side)
Use the “upload document” button at the bottom of the To do list.
Consult the step-by-step guide for uploading documents.
Applicants are encouraged to upload all their documents online to ensure that these are submitted by the admission application deadline . Note that it is up to you to verify if your program has additional requirements, such as portfolios, letters of intent, etc. Language proficiency test scores and original reference letters must be sent directly to Concordia. Once the file is complete with the required documents , it will be reviewed for admission.
I uploaded/sent in my documents but why do I still see them on “To Do List”?
Once you submit a required document, we will review your file again and remove that item from your “To Do List” in your Student Centre. Please note that it may take up to 15 working days to update your file. Please do not upload a document more than once.
I studied at another post-secondary institution. Will I get transfer credits?
Transfer credits may be awarded for university-level courses that are equivalent to Concordia courses and appropriate to the program to which you are applying. In order for us to make an evaluation of transfer credit, we must receive a formal application and all necessary supporting documents first. The transfer credit evaluation will be completed when we review your admissions application.
I am trying to pay the application fee but the payment window is not appearing.
In order to access the payment window, you’ll need to disable your browser’s pop-up blocker .
