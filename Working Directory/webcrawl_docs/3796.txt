JMAS invites you to our annual First Year Event!
We hope that your first few weeks of university have been exciting and you have begun to settle into your classes. We know how stressful and overwhelming this whole new experience can be and would like to relieve some of your stress with a cocktail/meet and greet. This will be a relaxed and comfortable environment where you can talk with other first year students, the JMAS team, and reps from various services within JMSB that work to help students.
Come join us September 23rd at Galt Bar which is only a few blocks away from school. This is the perfect opportunity to learn more about your new school and all the services JMSB has to offer. After a few brief presentations about potential involvement on campus, there will be a meet and greet with other students, which will give you the opportunity to build your network. Get your ticket today and don’t miss out on the opportunity to enhance your undergrad experience.
This event is for FIRST YEAR STUDENTS ONLY!
See you there!
