John Molson Trading League (JMTL)
The John Molson Trading League holds weekly competitions at the John Dobson Formula Growth Trading Lab using the Rotman Interactive Trader software. The league is designed to introduce students to equity and commodity trading, and different market structures.
The league encourages individuals to build trading models on Excel. Furthermore, trading algorithms, built by students, will be introduced this year to compete against other students. One of the Trading League’s functions is to recruit and train traders for next year’s Concordia University delegation at the Rotman International Trading Competition, where Concordia received a 1st place ranking in the S&P Capital IQ Equity Valuation Case, as well as a 5th place ranking overall this year.
