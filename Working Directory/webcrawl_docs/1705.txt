CONCORDIA GOLF CLASSIC
Monday, September 11, 2017
An annual tradition since 2004, the Concordia Golf Classic is one of the university's most successful fundraisers. Thanks to our generous sponsors, we've raised nearly $4.6 million for bursaries and scholarships and have helped more than 1,500 promising students. Yet the need continues — over half of Concordia’s 46,000 students rely on financial aid for books, tuition fees and living expenses. 
Join us for a beautiful day on the greens — or as sponsor and benefit from visibility at our highly successful event.
