Request for layout and design
Before submitting a file please contact our print representative to discuss your project. Your printing request should be submitted via e-mail at printing@concordia.ca and include the project details including quantity, size and paper choice, requested delivery date, the delivery address and departmental account code (the preferred method of payment).
Please consult with Print Advisory if an alternate method of payment is required.
File submission guidelines
Please submit a high resolution PDF file, preferably in single page format with crop marks and bleed (min. .125").
For large projects, please submit the native files: Place page layout files, fonts, all supporting graphics, and a hi-res PDF of the project (to ensure accurate reproduction) in a single folder, and compress the folder for submission.
To compress:
On a Mac, select the folder, then go to the "File" dropdown menu and select "Compressed (zipped) folder."
On a PC, right click on the folder, then go to "Send to" and select "Compressed (zipped) folder".
Submitting files
Please submit your files to the Print Advisory office
You may email us at printing@concordia.ca a PDF file or zipped folder (Your file(s) size must not exceed 10MB), or drop by the Print Advisory office with a USB Key.
Deadline and delivery
Because every printing request varies in its complexity it is sometimes difficult to predict how long a job will take to complete. Contact us and we will give you a time frame for the completion of your request.
There is no charge for delivery within Concordia University.
