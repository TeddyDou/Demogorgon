9 years, 36 cases, 864 competitors, 1 story.
 
While JMUCC strives to create the stars of tomorrow, we would be remiss to forget how the competition came to be the success it is today.

2016
Knowing full well she still had more to contribute, Melissa Palumbo was back as President of the 8th edition of the John Molson Undergraduate Case Competition – where she and her dream team of passionate, spirited and dynamic individuals set out to plan the most ambitious competition yet.
In 2016, JMUCC went completely live, incorporating sponsor commercials and interviews in between the cases that were being live streamed on JMUCC TV. Snapchat was incorporated as the 6th social media platform at the competition to provide a “behind the scenes” look for participants and viewers around the world.
In 2016, JMUCC strived to be recognized as a public event by allowing sponsors to be situated right at the centre of the action, each day at the competition. Companies such as Groupe Dynamite, Brother and Birks were among the first to test out this new sponsorship feature!
In 2016, the cases were more diverse than ever. The topics ranged from marketing, to growth and expansion and for the first time, human resources. The 24hr case was the most complex case yet, with over 4 interactive components for the teams to complete throughout the course of the day.
In 2016, JMUCC was more than just a competition: it was an experience. Teams came from around the world to compete and represent their schools, but left with so much more. It’s safe to say that in 2016 the John Molson Undergraduate Case Competition meant business. Competitors will remember the excitement, the stress, the exhaustion, but most of all the friendships, forged, and memories that will last a lifetime.

2015
Seven years, twenty-eight cases, and 672 competitors later, President Melissa Palumbo and her team of eight all-stars put a new definition to the word “business”.
In 2015, JMUCC brought challenges: the competitors found themselves face-to-face with some of the most complex and dynamic cases the competition has seen, from successfully integrating two iconic Montreal brands, Ogilvy and Holt Renfrew, to completing JMUCC’s first ever interactive 24-hour case, which involved bringing a new project funded by Cisco to market.
In 2015, JMUCC was truly international, bringing together schools from 13 different countries, and live-streaming all 102 presentations for the world to take part in the excitement of the week.
In 2015, JMUCC meant family: the competition welcomed back the University of Prince Edward Island and Memorial University, as well as some newcomers, namely the University of Melbourne, the University of New South Wales, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences, and the University of Muenster. As well, for the first time ever, the home team, Concordia University, won the title of JMUCC Champions.
In 2015, JMUCC meant more than just business: it made history.

In the sixth year since its inception, the John Molson Undergraduate Case Competition reached new heights as Bianca Bertoia and her team broke countless records. The competitors were faced with four B2B cases, and the industries presented ranged from healthcare, to transportation for the performing arts, and finally to technology for retail point of sale systems. Global Montreal was on site for the competition, and for the first time in the history of JMUCC, the final 24-hour cases were live-streamed, allowing families and friends around the world to join in the excitement of the finals as they were happening. As we move into 2015, we thank Bianca and her team for their hard work and dedication, and we thank the past Presidents for leaving such an honourable legacy.

2013
2013 marked the fifth anniversary of the John Molson Undergraduate Case Competition, and Guillaume Leverdier’s second year as President. The competition welcomed new universities such as the Queensland University of Technology and Salisbury University (USA), and for the first time in its history, had all international podium finishes. As well, Guillaume and esteemed board member, Anna Martini, were featured on Global Montreal’s morning news, where they discussed what exactly JMUCC means to competitors from around the world. Five years and five competitions later, JMUCC was stronger than ever.

Behind the Scenes at JMUCC 2013
2012
Twenty-four schools seemed to be the ideal number for JMUCC’s success. Guillaume Leverdier, both first year representative in 2010 and VP Logistics in 2011, took charge as President for the 2012 edition of JMUCC. The team – now composed of nine executives – definitely gave the competitors a week to remember, from cheering on the Habs, to solving diverse cases ranging from design, health, water technology and mining. This year’s JMUCC closed with an international win by the Netherlands’ Maastricht University.

Behind the Scenes at JMUCC 2012
2011
In its third year, President Mariann Rossi believed that JMUCC was ready for a small change: an additional four schools were added to the competition. These 24 schools and 96 competitors again competed in four live cases from companies with both Montreal and international recognition. With just six committee members, the team set the stage for future JMUCCs, and as one volunteer said, gave students “the most challenging, exciting, and gratifying week” of their undergraduate career.

In 2010, the John Molson Undergraduate Case Competition returned for a second time with a new President, Mariann Rossi, and with a unique added element: all four cases presented throughout the week were “live”, offered by real business requiring real solutions. Although some newer universities added to the diversity of the competition, Canada dominated the podium.

Final thoughts from JMUCC 2010
2009
2009 marked the inception of the “John Molson Undergraduate Case Competition”, the first multi-round business case competition. Under the leadership of Victor Esposito, the event brought twenty teams from ten international countries to the city of Montreal to compete in four cases. Unique to this competition was the 24-hour “live case”, a real-life business case offered by the Montreal Port Authority. It was apparent, even in its humble beginnings, that the competition was on the very brink of success.

Undergraduate National Case Competition
Before we called it “JMUCC”, the competition began its life as the Undergraduate National Case Competition – an event that welcomed Canadian schools from sea to shining sea. Beginning in 2003, UNCC was a very different competition from what JMUCC is today. Taking place over the span of one weekend, teams were expected to crack two cases, and the team with the highest score after the two cases was crowned the winner.
Then, in 2009, as Concordia University’s John Molson School of Business moved into its new home, it was time for the competition to grow.
