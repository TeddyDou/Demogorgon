Club Description: 
Amidst the hype of artificial intelligence in Montreal, AISC has decided not to leave the Concordia community left behind. We want to bring our community to the frontier of artificial intelligence and machine learning. AISC will be preparing a series of talks by industry professionals and scientists, community meetups, workshops, cocktails, and conferences. Our main focus will be on the applications of machine learning and natural language processing and how are they affecting the status quo of rising startups and well-situated businesses. As to our long-term goal, AISC is aiming to bring in various sources of funding to AI research labs at Concordia and get more students engaged in AI.
