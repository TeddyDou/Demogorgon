Patrols
To ensure a safe and secure campus environment, Concordia’s Security Department patrols the premises of both Sir George Williams and Loyola campuses on an ongoin basis, both on foot or and in a patrol car.
Security agents are professionals who are trained to deal with emergencies and are available to answer your questions or provide support. They play a key role in making our campuses safe. Do not hesitate to seek their advice or support.
Safe Walk
A Safe Walk Program, also commonly referred to as accompaniment services, is available to members of the Concordia community, 24 hours a day.
You can call Security at (514) 848-3717 to request an agent to accompany you to your vehicle, public transport route, or on-campus location. This service is subject to assessment and certain restrictions.
