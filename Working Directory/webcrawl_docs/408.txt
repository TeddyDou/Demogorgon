Computer Engineering
Electrical Engineering
Software Engineering
Computer Science
Admission to the program is competitive and only applicants with high academic standing will be considered. Qualified applicants requiring prerequisite courses may be asked to take such courses in addition to their regular graduate program. The Faculty Graduate Studies Committee, in consultation with the Institute, is responsible for the recommendation of all applications for admission.
Residence requirements. The minimum residence requirement for the Master’s degree is three terms (one year) of full-time study, or the equivalent in part-time study.
Transfer from the Master of Engineering in Information Systems Security. Students, in good standing, who have completed a minimum of 12 credits in the Master of Engineering in Information Systems Security, may apply for a transfer to the Master of Applied Science in Information Systems Security.
Degree requirements
The requirements described here are in addition to the general degree requirements for the Master’s programs in the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science.
In order to graduate, students must have a CGPA of at least 3.00.
Program of Study. The student will follow the proposed course sequence. In addition, students have to consult with their supervisor for selecting a research topic. Students can enter this program as Co-op students. See item 6. Thesis
Credits. A fully qualified candidate is required to successfully complete a minimum of 45 credits. Additional credits may be required in some cases.
Transfer Credits. Students may be granted transfer academic credits for, in general, not more than eight credits taken in approved graduate studies prior to their entry into this program. A course submitted for transfer credit must be appropriate to the student’s program of study at Concordia University. An application for such credit will be considered only at the time of admission.
Time Limit. Please refer to the Academic Regulation page for further details regarding the Time Limit requirements.
Courses. Students must complete a minimum of 20 credits, including 16 credits of core courses (INSE 6110, INSE 6120, INSE 6130, and INSE 6140) and one 4-credit course as shown below:
a course chosen from the topic area E69 Information Systems Security, approved by the student’s supervisor, or
an INSE course, approved by the student’s supervisor and either the Graduate Program Director or the Director of the Institute.
 
Thesis. Students must complete a 25-credit thesis as part of their degree requirements. The thesis must represent the results of the student’s independent work after admission to the program.
