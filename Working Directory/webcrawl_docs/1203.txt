Fine Arts Student Alliance (FASA)

FASA seeks to improve the quality of Fine Arts student life at Concordia by representing students to the University administration, offering a variety of services and organizing diverse social events. FASA is always looking for students to volunteer and help out with campaigns and events. For more information, visit the FASA website .
