Biography
Peter Shizgal is a behavioral neurobiologist who studies brain mechanisms of reward, motivation, learning, and decision making. His research combines behavioural and neurochemical measurements with mathematical modeling and optogenetic perturbation of neural signalling. Shizgal is a professor emeritus and an Honorary Concordia University Senior Research Chair. A graduate of McGill University (BA) and the University of Pennsylvania (MA, PhD), he has spent sabbatical leaves at the Department of Neurobiology and Behavior at Stony Brook University and at the Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging (Harvard / MIT). Shizgal is a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Association for Psychological Science, and the American Psychological Association. He is a recipient of the NutraSweet Prize for research in feeding and nutrition as well as the “prix Adrien Pinard" of the “Societé Québeçoise pour la Recherche en Psychologie.”

Research
Overview: I study the neural basis of reward, motivation, learning and decision-making.
How do animals evaluate competing goals and select alternatives that address their biological needs? What kinds of computations are performed in carrying out such evaluations, and how are these computations implemented by the brain? These questions are fundamental to my research on the neural basis of motivation and reward. My research team and I use a combination of psychophysical, electrochemical, electrophysiological, neuroanatomical and optogenetic methods to identify neurons involved in reward seeking in the rat. A related line of research is aimed at shedding light on the function of the circuitry within which these neurons are embedded. This work includes operant conditioning studies, mathematical modelling within the behavioural economic and reinforcement-learning traditions, and experiments on the interaction of physiological feedback, sensory inputs, and reward signals induced by electrical or optical stimulation.
Funding
My research is funded by the "Fonds de recherche du Québec – Nature et technologies (FRQNT)" the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), and a Team Accelerator grant from Concordia University.

Biography
Peter Shizgal was an undergraduate student at McGill University and earned a BA in Honours Psychology Program in 1971. He then undertook graduate studies at the University of Pennsylvania, first carrying out research under the supervision of Philip Teitelbaum and then under the supervision of Randy Gallistel. He was awarded a Ph.D. in Psychology in 1975 and joined the faculty of Concordia University. In 1981-82, he was a visiting Associate Professor at the Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, State University of New York at Stony Brook, and in 2000, he spent a sabbatical leave at the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Center of the Massachusetts General Hospital. He served as Director of the CSBN from 1997-2003 and has been a member of grant-review committees at the federal and provincial levels. In 1994 he won the NutraSweet Prize for research in nutrition and feeding, and in 2011 he was awarded the Prix Adrien Pinard by the Société québecoise pour la recherche en psychologie. A fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Psychological Association, and the American Psychological Society, he holds a Senior Concordia University Research Chair.
