"A Place for Reflecting" MATTHEW HALEY (Student) To me, Concordia increases in its value when I see it as a place for reflection.

It can be a really stressful time. In this picture, which is permeated with reflections, students seem to be stopped in the midst of their rush in Concordia’s Webster Library. ...
