Insurance coverage
When you visit us, be sure to have your:
Concordia ID
Valid (not expired) health insurance card
For Canadian students, your provincial/territorial health card ('Medicare card')
For international students, proof of insurance coverage such as the Blue Cross plan
Doctors are paid by health insurance, so to see a doctor, you must bring your valid health insurance card. If you don't have your card, we will charge you for the visit and give you a receipt.  Contact your insurance provider about reimbursement.
You do not need to show your health insurance card to see a nurse or health promotion specialist, as they are paid by your student fees.
Health Services does not manage the many different insurance plans Concordia students can buy. You pay hundreds of dollars a year for your insurance plan: learn what it covers and how to get reimbursed, and use it.
Insurance information for Canadian students from outside Quebec
While you are studying full-time outside your province of residence, your provincial health insurance can cover your basic medical expenses.  However, coverage is not automatic:  You must contact your province’s health insurance provider before you leave your province to inform them that you will be studying in Quebec and wish to remain covered.  This procedure varies from province to province (see links below).  You must inform them each year while studying out of province.  If you are required to demonstrate proof of full-time studies at Concordia to maintain your coverage you can obtain a letter of attestation from the Birk’s Student Service Center.  Please note that there is a $20 fee to obtain this letter and a $5 fee if you wish it to have it faxed.
