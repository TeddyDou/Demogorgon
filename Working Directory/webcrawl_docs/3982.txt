CONSAT-1 Satellite
Short Summary
Consat-1 is Space Concordia’s first satellite that is tasked to study the radiation patterns of the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA). The SAA is a region where the Earth's inner Van Allen belt comes closest to the Earth's surface, and is infamous for causing strange fluctuations in radiation intensity. The development of Consat-1 marked the creation of Space Concordia and continues to be revered as one of the society’s greatest successes. Not only is it an incredible piece of engineering, but Consat-1 is also a symbol for Space Concordia as its legacy continues to inspire the society’s students to strive for innovation and excellence.
