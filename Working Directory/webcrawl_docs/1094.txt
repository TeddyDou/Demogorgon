The JMSB Co-op advantage
The JMSB Co-op programs offer you the unique opportunity to give your career plans a head-start. As a JMSB Co-op student, you will be able to apply what you learn in class to three paid work terms. Plus your work terms will allow you to explore different types of jobs in your chosen major and, in the process, develop a better understanding of what interests and motivates you.
Our graduates continuously tell us that they are so much further ahead in their careers than other students as a result of their having been in the JMSB Co-op program. They are more focused on their career choices, they are hired more quickly after graduation and they start at higher salaries, too. 
To find out more about the JMSB Co-op programs, please contact our Administrative Assistant at coop.jmsb@concordia.ca or by phone at 514-848-2424, ext. 4117. We very much look forward to hearing from you.
We have Co-ops in:
Accountancy
Finance
Human Resource Management
International Business
Business Technology Management
Marketing
Supply Chain Operations Management
