Classroom information and support
Support of classroom technology (Crestron, projectors, classroom PCs) across both campuses including usage orientation and problem troubleshooting. See Documentation for information concerning the technology available in each classroom and instructions on how to use it.
Classroom bookings are completed by Academic Scheduling. This service is related solely to the IT Services and/or equipment within your pre-booked space.
Who can use it?
Faculty, staff, and anyone else who has authority to use the classroom equipment can request assistance.  
How much does it cost?
Classroom support for credit courses is free of charge. For non-academic bookings, consult the Equipment Loan and Rental
page.
How to get it
1. To request additional equipment in the classroom (overhead, document camera, etc.) or to have a technician make the integrated equipment available to you before the start of your class, submit a request form or contact the Service Desk .
2. To use and obtain access to equipment in classrooms, a key is required. Please visit the closest geographically located Service Centre to request a key.
3. For immediate classroom support, phone or visit the closest geographically located Service Centre for assistance over the phone or to have a technician dispatched to the classroom.
If your classroom has a designated classroom support team, please contact them directly.  
Service availability

FAQ
My classroom is not in the CC, H, or MB building. Which Service Centre should I contact?
Please contact the closest geographically located Service Centre. For example, all classrooms at the Loyola Campus are supported by the Loyola Service Centre.
What happens if the classroom problem cannot be resolved?
Technicians always do their best to resolve problems immediately and have access to spare equipment in the case of failure. If the problem cannot be resolved, these incidents will be escalated to a higher level support team which will ensure resolution and follow-up with our clients.
Can I bring my own laptop to connect to a classroom projector?
Check the IT Service Catalog’s documentation for the classroom you’re using to determine the types of available connections. Currently, VGA is the standard connection type, although there are some rooms that now support HDMI. If you have an Apple device such as a Macbook or Ipad, you will need to supply your own adapter. If you’re unsure of what kind of adapter you need or how to connect your device to the projector, contact the closest Service Centre.
