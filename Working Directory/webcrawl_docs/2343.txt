About the research
Dr. Nathan Brown, Canada Research Chair in Poetics , is offering one scholarship opportunity for a student applying for a PhD in Concordia Universityâ€™s Department of English. The student will coordinate activities at the Centre for Expanded Poetics (CEP) , an interdisciplinary research centre for the study of structure, form, and fabrication across the arts and sciences. The focus of our work at the CEP over the next four years will be a project titled Expanded Poetics: Romantic, Modernist, Contemporary, which will critically periodize contemporary "interdisciplinarity" by situating it in relation to the Jena Romantic's understanding of Poesie as a general science and Modernist practics of inter-arts experimentation.  Duties will include event organizing, archival research, and acquiring working knowledge in the operation of equipment at the Centre (including touch tables, Risograph digital duplicator, 3D printer, and archival scanner). 
Financial commitment
The selected candidate will be offered an annual Research Assistant fellowship of $10,000, and be considered for additional Entrance Awards such as the Concordia University Graduate Fellowship ($32,400), Merit Scholarship ($10,000), Concordia International Tuition Award of Excellence (PhD - $35,949).
Requirements
The successful applicant will have an interest in 20th and 21st century poetry, the visual arts, and interdiscplinary approaches to humanities study, and will have opportunities present at conferences, write articles, and disseminate research. The candidate will be an affiliate of the Centre for Expanded Poetics and join a thriving network of scholars across the arts and humanities at Concordia University.
