The Thesis Office
Prepare, submit or search for a thesis
The Thesis Office is housed in the School of Graduate Studies at 1550 de Maisonneuve West and can help you with preparing and submitting your thesis in accordance with university guidelines. We also manage an online thesis archive which you can search.
Prepare your thesis
Students who are in the process of writing their thesis are encouraged to consult the  Thesis Preparation Guide  that outlines guidelines on thesis format as well as information pertaining to thesis defences and the final approval process.
Students are encouraged to consult  Guidelines for supervisor and Graduate Students .
Technical Regulations for all theses
If you have any questions about the exact formatting or layout for your thesis, this is the section for you! It provides guidelines for both the formatting and sequence of contents. All the technical regulations are laid out here so that you can get the formatting right the first time around, leaving you with more time to focus on what matters most: the contents of your thesis! 
Thesis Submission Process
Have questions about the process involved in submitting your thesis? You can consult this section. It outlines the step-by-step process for Master’s students  and for Doctoral students  so you know exactly what needs to happen and in what order. 
Search for a thesis
In the Concordia Library Repository, Spectrum , you will find a searchable online database of theses produced from 1967 – 2003. It houses over 6000 electronic copies.
Thesis defences
Thesis defences are public events and students are encouraged to attend. Master defences are organized at the program level. Students should check with the graduate program assistant in their program for information on upcoming exams. Visit our calendar of events  section to obtain details on upcoming defences.
