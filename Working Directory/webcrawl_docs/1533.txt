DB Clarke Theatre
The D.B. Clarke Theatre, located in the heart of downtown Montreal, is a fully equipped, 387-seat proscenium theatre.
Newly refurbished, the theatre boasts comfortable new seating as well as upgrades to rigging, dressing rooms and the lobby.
Ideal for theatre, music and dance productions, the D.B. Clarke is one of the principal performing-arts venues in the Faculty of Fine Arts. The theatre is also used on a regular basis by independent promoters and theatre companies and is the preferred location for many local and international conferences.
A  new video  highlights the renovated facilities, including the theatre's new seats, curtain and carpeting, beautifully refurbished teak interior, upgraded fly system, and reconfigured lobby. Additionally, a  360 degree panoramic virtual tour  of the theatre is available.
