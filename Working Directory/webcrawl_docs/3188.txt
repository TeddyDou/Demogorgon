Club Description: 
Formed by students in 2010, the Concordia JKA Shotokan Karate Students Association promotes, facilitates and lives by the Shotokan karate lifestyle. Our traditional dojo teaches ancestral ways of bettering both body and mind, as do all dojos under the banner of the JKA Shotokan Karate-do World Organisation of Canada. Some of our members have a competition-oriented routine while others prefer to train in the confines of the dojo. All have the opportunity to be the karateka they want to be.
