Exercise Science (BSc)
Bachelor of Science (BSc)
Offered by:
Department of Exercise Science , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why study Exercise Science?
Explore the science behind human exercise, health and physical activity. Our programs give you the professional knowledge and skills to interpret, apply and conduct health science research. You learn to assess, evaluate and design programs that can maintain and improve health, fitness and athletic performance.
Through lectures, hands-on lab instruction and internships, you practise clinical skills related to rehabilitation, and the improvement or maintenance of personal health. Working in small groups and using state-of-the-art facilities, you study a range of people, from individuals suffering from chronic disease to elite athletes.
Our department offers you three options to specialize in:
Honours program : gives you the chance to participate in focused research with faculty
Athletic Therapy : the only program of its kind in Eastern Canada, accredited by the Canadian Athletic Therapists Association (CATA)
Clinical Exercise Physiology : assess, evaluate and design exercise programs for people requiring special medical attention
Whatever option you choose, you will graduate with an applied knowledge of health science that focuses on health and fitness.
