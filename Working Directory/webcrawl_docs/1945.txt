English Literature (PhD)
Doctorate (PhD)
Offered by:
Department of English , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why pursue a Doctorate in English?
Take your training as a literary scholar to the next level.  Deepen your mastery of period- and area-specific archives as you develop the intensive disciplinary self-consciousness that propels the renewal of the field.
You’ll investigate the cultural categories of literature and the media, in both historical and contemporary contexts. Inspired by Concordia’s rich culture of interdisciplinary collaboration and its location in a vibrant, bilingual city, you’ll study literatures in English in the context of cross-disciplinary, cross-cultural, and cross-linguistic environments and exchanges.
The program will be of special interest to those doctoral students with the desire and skills necessary to work across discourses, media, or literary languages and/or traditions.
