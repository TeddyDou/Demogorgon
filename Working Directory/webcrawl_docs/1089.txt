Student testimonials
A new level of confidence:
    
Program Highlights:
    
Challenging, but rewarding:
    
Joining the JMSB EMBA program is one of the best decisions of my life. The exposure to new learning, through excellent professors and the cohort alike, has been enriching and life changing. I have been able to put these learnings to use in my work environment since week 1 of the program. 
Andrea Limbardi 
EMBA 2016
 
Enrolling in the EMBA program equipped me with mindset and analytical tools that have allowed me to truly succeed in a business environment. The ability to overcome the challenges of managing a career, family, and the EMBA workload, afforded me with the confidence to realize that anything is possible, and no challenge is too daunting. This degree has created opportunities for me in my career.
Andrea Polatos
EMBA 2009
I enrolled in the John Molson Executive MBA to broaden my management skills without having to leave my job. I believe that the tools as well as the professional and personal resources that I developed during the Program provide me with a competitive advantage in a highly competitive business world.
