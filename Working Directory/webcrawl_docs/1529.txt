Co-op programs
Co-op offers practical experience opportunities to students in about 40 academic programs across all faculties in the university at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.
Explore the list of available Co-op programs in each faculty.  Each section explains the breakdown of the program’s study/work sequence and describes the tasks you might be asked to do:
Faculty of Arts & Science
Faculty of Engineering & Computer Science
Faculty of Fine Arts
John Molson School of Business
Industrial Experience Option & Professional Experience Option
In addition to Co-op programs, we offer alternative work term options to students studying engineering, computer science, physics, computation arts, and design. The Industrial Experience Option and Professional Experience Option offer similar benefits as our regular Co-op programs, but in a different format.
