Geography, Urban and Environmental Studies (PhD)
Doctorate (PhD)
Offered by:
Department of Geography, Planning & Environment , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why pursue a Doctorate in Geography, Urban and Environmental Studies?
Gain a deeper understanding of how humans interact and intervene with the world around them. Learn about the socio-cultural and environmental dimensions of human settlements as they evolve. Develop insights into environmental changes spanning from local to global that will shed light on the past and the present, help predict the future, and guide strategies for more sustainable human livelihoods and settlements.
The PhD in Geography, Urban and Environmental Studies provides methodological tools to understand the complex nature of reciprocating interactions between humans and the environment. Course materials integrate biological, ecological, social, GIS, cultural, economic, historical, legal and ethical perspectives to address issues that arise while developing solutions for the natural environment and strategies to build sustainable human lifestyles.
Translate your knowledge into practice in courses that emphasize learning and pedagogical training. Our students gain invaluable experience in their field of research through a 200-hour work placement in the private sector, a research laboratory based outside of Concordia, a non-profit organization or the government. Students are also required to teach four lectures of an undergraduate course after successfully completing a seminar in university teaching with the Centre for Teaching and Learning .
Work in conjunction with acclaimed faculty members who have received the highest honours from the Royal Society of Canada’s College of New Scholars and the Canada Research Chairs Program. Our researchers have a diverse range of expertise in the natural sciences, social sciences and humanities, allowing you to take a truly interdisciplinary approach to your specific area of research interest.
