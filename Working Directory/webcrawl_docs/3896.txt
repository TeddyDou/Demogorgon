Author, Sportsnet
Sportsnet  Author, CHRIS JOHNSTON, will be speaking at  #JMSM17 !
Chris, well known as Reporter Chris, started off his writing career with The Canadian Press, knowing that he wanted to work in sports. At age five Chris told his parents that he wanted to cover hockey in any way, shape or form, and all these years later he is living the dream.
He is now in his 14th season of covering the NHL and is in his fifth year with Sportsnet. He is a Senior Hockey Writer for Sportsnet, Insider at  NHL Network , Canadian Press Sports and @RyersonJourn alumnus. Along with the NHL, Chris has covered two Olympics, ten Stanley Cup finals, seven IIHF World Hockey Championships and too many other big games to count. He’s even done three Masters and a British Open thrown in for good measure. He is a frequent contributor to Sportsnet’s TV and radio platforms and a regular guest on the “Puck Talks” speaking series.
“Do what you love and love what you do.” Is a phrase that sticks out with Chris and he tries to live by all these years later.
