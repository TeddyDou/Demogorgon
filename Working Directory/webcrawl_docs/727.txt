"In the eyes of the beholder": Re-visiting formative myths and stories in contemporary Israeli video artworks
November 22, 2017, 1:30 p.m. – 3 p.m.
The Azrieli Institute of Israel Studies' Graduate Student-Faculty Seminar Series presents 
Dr. Sigal Barkai
Postdoctoral Fellow, Azrieli Institute of Israel Studies, Concordia University, and Curator and researcher of contemporary Israeli art
In recent decades, an expressive and innovative art form has evolved in the field of experimental video and film in Israel. Female artists such as Nira Pereg, Maya Zack and Yael Bartana are working in elaborate digital media which enables them to respond to political, personal and cultural issues through sophisticatedly edited documentary video, or through reflective, melancholic and ironic mockumentary films, or through grandiose and macabre cinematic fantasies. The stories of the Bible, the heavy shadow of the Holocaust hovering over Israeli existence on a daily basis, or the myths associated with the Holy Temple are dealt with in daring, provocative and subversive pieces, which will be presented and discussed in the seminar.
More details can be found in  the event flyer . For more information, please contact the Azrieli Institute of Israel Studies at  azrieliinstitute@concordia.ca  or 514-848-2424 ext. 8721. 
Please RSVP by Tuesday, November 21  to reserve your place.
