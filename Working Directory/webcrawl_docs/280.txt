About the research sector
Concordia’s research activities add $177 million annually to the Quebec economy. That’s why the Office of Vice-President, Research and Graduate Studies (OVPRGS) takes great pride in serving and supporting the university’s researchers. The Office offers an array of services to help dedicated researchers and promote the results of their research — whether it’s maximizing funding opportunities, establishing international research partnerships or guiding them through the university’s policies and procedures.
Managing more than 100 graduate programs and 6,500 students, the Office also oversees admissions standards and graduation requirements. Since graduate students play a key role in research, the Office provides several services – from application to thesis – to support graduate students.

Research Integrity
Fundamentally, the public expects that academics act with integrity, since research is the cornerstone of our profession. At Concordia, we have aligned ourselves to the highest standards set by federal and provincial funding agencies.
The research integrity officer provides information, support, training and assistance to scholars in fulfilling all obligations related to principles of ethical conduct.
These standards are consistent with the requirements of federal and provincial funding agencies and other sponsors at the university, and are outlined in detail in the Policy for the Responsible Conduct of Research .
If you have any questions relating to the integrity research at Concordia, contact Cameron Skinner, research integrity officer, directly and confidentially, at rio@concordia.ca or 514-848-2424, ext. 3341.
