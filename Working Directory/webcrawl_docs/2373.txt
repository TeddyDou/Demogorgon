Financial aid and awards
Undergraduate students
Entrance Scholarships are awarded to newly admitted students from a CEGEP or a secondary school outside of Quebec who have achieved a high academic standing. In order to be eligible, students must be a Canadian citizen or a permanent resident and must have applied by the official application deadline date(s).
Eligible students are ranked, and the highest ranked students are contacted by the Dean's Office and asked to reply by specified deadlines using the Arts & Science Scholarship Confirmation form.
For more information on bursaries and scholarships, visit the Financial Aid and Awards website .

Did you know?
Students applying to Concordia from elsewhere in Canada should be aware that tuition rates in Quebec are among the lowest, if not the lowest, in North America.
In particular, at the PhD level, all Canadian students and permanent residents pay Quebec fees regardless of their province of origin or domicile at the time of application.
