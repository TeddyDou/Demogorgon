Your questions answered
How long will it take before students receive an admission decision?
Applicants will receive a response anywhere from 48 hours for Cegep students to eight weeks or more for international students. Because the admissions process varies for each student and program, we cannot give specific dates for a decision. See more details about the  application assessment period . The best thing for your student to do is to keep checking back at  MyConcordia.ca  for an update on the status of their application.
What scholarships are available?
For all information on available scholarships and financial aid, please visit the pages of our  Financial Aid and Awards Office .
How big are the classes?
Concordia University strives to keep class sizes small and manageable, allowing students to create lasting relationships with their professors, as well as get the full advantages offered to them by having direct access to their instructors. Approximately two thirds of our first-year undergraduate courses have fewer than 60 students.
What should students do if they are having trouble in a course?
At Concordia, there are many resources available to assist students if they are having trouble with their academics. Professors and teaching assistants have office hours, and academic advising is available through each individual  Faculty .
We also offer a variety of academic services, such as tutoring, mentoring and skills workshops and personal support through our Student Success Centre .
We offer personal counselling and support through Counselling and Psychological Services .  
How safe are university campuses?
The  Concordia University Security Department  is dedicated to maintaining a secure university environment which allows students to study, work and live in a safe setting. Our school maintains 24-hour campus patrol, and all of our residences are equipped with both an access card and key system in order to maximize safety.
Furthermore, students can opt to receive emergency alerts from the university via email or text message on their cell phone. They can sign up for this service through their  MyConcordia portal , under the “Messaging” tab.
The  Office of Emergency Management  at Concordia University uses  Facebook  and other channels to promote emergency preparedness and  alert the community of emergencies  on or around campus.
There are two campuses? How do students get from Sir George Williams to Loyola in time for class?
Students, faculty, and staff with a valid Concordia ID card can take advantage of a free, 20-minute  shuttle bus service  between campuses. Our shuttle buses run on a regular  schedule , approximately every 20 to 25 minutes.
Or, for avid cyclists, the city’s De Maisonneuve bike path connects our two campuses for an easy ride.
What public transportation options are available in Montreal?
The  Société de transport de Montréal  (STM) maintains an extensive network of bus routes and underground metro stations throughout the city that is reliable and easy to use. In addition, the STM offers a reduced-fare monthly bus/metro pass (the OPUS card) for students.
How to obtain your OPUS card .
For more information on the OPUS card, including restrictions, fees and travel fare details, please consult the  STM website .
What if a student becomes sick?
Each of our campuses has a dedicated Health Services clinic. For more information on the health services and  medical insurance coverage  available to the student in your family, visit our  Health Services  website. For information on the  Concordia Health Insurance Plan for International Students , please visit our  International Students Office .
Should students get a part-time job in first year?
During university, a student’s first job is schoolwork — and that can be a full-time job in itself. We recommend that students allow for an extra two to three hours of school work and studying for each hour spent in class. This means that a full-time student will be busy with 45 to 60 hours of school work per week.
However, many students are able to balance a part-time job during their studies, and we offer many opportunities right here,  on campus . There are also many paid positions listed on the Concordia University Off-Campus Housing and Job Bank, or  HoJo , as we like to call it.
Can parents or guardians view student grades?
Student records are available to the student, and to authorized University staff and faculty only. Students may obtain a copy of their record through the Concordia student portal,  MyConcordia.ca . They may also obtain a physical copy ($5 fee) from the  Birks Student Service Centre  during normal operating hours, or by written request.
Can parents or guardians view the outstanding balance on a student’s tuition?
Tuition receipts and access to student account balances are only available to students via the  MyConcordia student portal .
We offer several online tools to assist students with the payment of  tuition and fees ; however, we encourage parents and guardians to remind students to verify their account balance, and to make note of  payment deadlines .
