Early Childhood and Elementary Education (BA)
Bachelor of Arts (BA)
Offered by:
Department of Education , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why study Early Childhood and Elementary Education?
Shape the future. Experience the magic and mystery of the world through the eyes of a child. As an educator, you’ll nurture children and inspire them to explore their surroundings. A BA in Early Childhood and Elementary Education gives you an educational foundation for teaching children aged two to 12.
In a curriculum that combines theory and fieldwork, you’ll have the opportunity to observe experienced teachers and teach classes as a student teacher. You’ll follow a core education curriculum and take electives in the teaching of values, second languages and human, social and natural sciences. You’ll also:
Examine Canadian social policy and its impact on children and families
Study the physical, emotional and psychological development of children aged two to 12
Study educational psychology and philosophy
Learn methods of teaching first and second languages, mathematics and social sciences
Our students graduate ready to enter Quebec classrooms, and are eligible for certification from the Ministère de l'Éducation, du Loisir et du Sport.
Program details
Program options & degree requirements
The Department of Education offers one of Canada's finest undergraduate teacher certification programs, a 4-year BA, Specialization in ECEE that leads to permanent certification to teach in Quebec schools. This program is designed for students wishing to teach preschool through Grade 6. 
The Bachelor of Arts degree with a Specialization in ECEE takes a minimum of four years (120 credits) of full-time study, depending on your academic background .
Concentration
Specialization in Early Childhood and Elementary Education (120 credits)
Program structure
The program requires 93 credits for the Specialization programme plus 27 elective credits. The 93 credits involve a stimulating and well-balanced group of selections from three areas: theory courses, method courses, and internships.
The internships will be undertaken in preschool, kindergarten, primary and elementary level classes. The program has a strong emphasis on child development. We believe that it is important to know how children grow and develop in order to better meet their needs. To facilitate this, the internships progress from preschool to higher elementary placements.
