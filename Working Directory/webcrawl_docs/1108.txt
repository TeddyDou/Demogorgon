Our building
The John Molson School of Business building (MB) is the dynamic green centre of Concordia University’s John Molson School of Business (JMSB). This architecturally stunning 37,000-square-metre 15-storey landmark boasts a distinctive design that incorporates bright atriums, modern classrooms, several networking spaces, a 300-seat auditorium, six amphitheatres and two basement levels that link it to neighbouring buildings and to the metro system. The building was awarded LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Silver level certification by the Canada Green Building Council.

Emphasis on sustainable development & social issues
The building was awarded LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Silver level certification by the Canada Green Building Council.
The building's southwest sidewall is considered the first ever " Solar Wall " in the world: the solar panels stretch the length of the south-west side of the mechanical penthouse, covering an approximate surface area of 300 square meters. The photovoltaic panels will generate up to 25 kW of electricity and 75 kW of heat. That's enough energy to turn on 1,250 CFL light bulbs, and provide heat for 7 Canadian homes throughout the year.
