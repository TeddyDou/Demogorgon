Club Description: 
Traditional Chinese Han culture club is a organization seeking ancient wisdom and beauty of Han Culture such as Hanfu(traditional Chinese clothing), KungFu tea ceremony, floral arts and Chinese philosophy. Also, we expect to give sensual and visual pleasure to our audiences by representing our arts and to experience new life style with health and happiness.
The purpose of Traditional Chinese Han Culture is to gather up people whoever are interested in traditional Chinese culture and study it together , to learn all kinds of things including
Hanfu(traditional clothing worn by the Chinese Han ethnic group)
Traditional Chinese Philosophy including Confucius, Daoism, and Buddhism
Kung Fu Tea
Floral art(Traditional Chinese way to arrange flowers with montain sword)
Calligraphy
Traditional music instruments
Traditional dance
To promote the traditional value of harmony, courage, righteousness, courtesy, wisdom, honesty, loyalty, and filial piety.
 
Our goal: when people wear Hanfu as casual clothes at school, no one mistakes it as Korea Hanbok or Japanese Kimono.
People could wear Hanfu as a formal clothes in ceremony or important meetings.
When people talk about floriculture or tea classification, they also know these arts originally come from China.
