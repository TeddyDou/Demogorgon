David Howes's Explore Concordia page
David Howes is Professor of Anthropology and Co-Director of the Centre for Sensory Studies at Concordia University, Montreal. He is also the Director of the Concordia Centre for Interdisciplinary Studies in Society and Culture (CISSC) and an Adjunct Professor in the Faculty of Law, McGill University.
Beginning in 1990, David has conducted field research on the cultural life of the senses in Papua New Guinea, Northwestern Argentina, and the Southwestern United States. His research projects over the past 10 years have ranged from exploring the sensory life of things in the Pitt Rivers Museum, Oxford to investigating historic and contemporary trends in multisensory marketing in the USA and Canada (in collaboration with Bianca Grohmann of the Department of Marketing) and from examining judicial constructions of “culture” to designing performative sensory environments (together with Chris Salter of the Department of Design Art). He is currently directing a project entitled “Law and the Regulation of the Senses: Explorations in Sensori-Legal Studies.”
David is the editor of, among other works, The Varieties of Sensory Experience (Toronto, 1991), Cross-Cultural Consumption (Routledge, 1996), Empire of the Senses (Berg, 2004) and A Cultural History of the Senses in the Modern Age, 1920-2000 (Bloomsbury, 2014). He is the co-author (with Constance Classen and Anthony Synnott) of Aroma: The Cultural History of Smell (Routledge, 1994), and (also with ConstanceClassen) Ways of Sensing: Understanding the Senses in Society (Routledge, 2013). He is also the author of Sensual Relations: Engaging the Senses in Culture and Social Theory (Michigan, 2003).
David is the general editor of the Sensory Formations series from Berg and the new Sensory Studies series from Bloomsbury,as well as a founding editor of the journal The Senses and Society.  He also curates a number of websites, including
