Emergency Preparedness
We don't plan to fail, but we often fail to plan.
 
Taking a few moments to consider what emergencies you may be exposed to and planning for those emergencies before they happen will ensure that you are better prepared to deal with the emergency if and when it occurs.
Recent disasters have demonstrated that even in the most developed countries, we must takes steps to prepare to be self sufficient for at least the first 72 hours following a disaster.
The university undertakes preparedness and prevention activities on an institutional level but encourages all staff and students to do so as well.
Below are a few simple ways to prepare yourself for an emergency situation:
Take a few minutes to review established  emergency procedures
Take a first aid and/or fire prevention course
Become a CERT volunteer
Attend an Emergency Preparedness seminar
Ensure that you and your family have supplies to be self sufficient for 72 hours
