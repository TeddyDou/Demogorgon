Ottawa Chapter Bursary Endowment
The Ottawa Chapter established an Endowment Fund to support an annual entrance bursary of $500 for a Concordia University undergraduate student from the Ottawa region.
Our goal is to grow the Endowment Fund to $20,000, so that we can offer a second entrance bursary to yet another deserving student.
