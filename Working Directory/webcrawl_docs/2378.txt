Science Hub
Version française
The expansion of the Richard J. Renaud Science Complex will provide our scientific community with new state-of-the-art research facilities and equipment that will help enhance research, innovation and training at Concordia University.
The new space, for which we are aiming for a LEED Gold certification, has been strategically designed to physically connect researchers between spaces, encouraging interdisciplinary collaboration and research. It will house laboratories and research spaces supporting research fields such as agriculture, health and sustainable development.
The landscaping around the building was designed to improve the biomass of the existing property and the quality of life of the Concordia community and Loyola neighbors. The space will feature outdoor living spaces for work, relaxation and meditation, revitalizing the outdoor surroundings to create a new and unique environment to meet, exchange idea or simply wander.

FAQ
About the location
Why is the new hub being built in this particular spot?
The new Science Hub is required to be in the current spot for two reasons. First, it needs to be located in an area that was approved by the borough when we presented our master plan for future growth in 2001. Additionally, the new science hub must be located in close proximity to the existing Science Pavilion to physically connect researchers in both spaces, to provide easy access between the two spaces and to provide Concordia’s scientific community with a unified science complex which encourages interdisciplinary research and a collaborative atmosphere for innovation.
Is it not possible to build somewhere else and preserve existing greenspace?
The grass field has little significant ecological value at the moment. While a small amount of green space will be lost due to the expansion, our landscaping plans to add trees and plants will boost the biomass above and beyond the borough’s recommendations. The borough requested that we replace the lost grass with new landscaping that would ensure the replacement of lost biomass within 10 years. In fact, our landscaping plan will actually allow us to replace the lost biomass in just four years.  And, at maturity, the benefits of the new biomass will actually be six times greater than if we left it as mere grass. The new landscaping is designed to improve the quality of life of students and nearby residents with outdoor living spaces for work, relaxation and meditation. Some 40 trees will be planted to provide shade and create tree-lined pedestrian and vehicle corridors. Our landscaping plans will also showcase a Walter Furher sculpture. “Transcendence” was one of twenty artworks commissioned for Expo 67 and donated to Loyola.
Is Concordia permitted to build on the land selected for this project?
Concordia was granted permission to build on this space in 2001, when the borough approved our master plan for future growth on the campus. We do not have permission to build on current parking lots in the vicinity of the project. We are seeking a derogation because in 2001, when the plan was approved, we foresaw building a residence for students on this site. Now, 16 years later, we realize that we are much more in need of a science hub than a residence. The change is not problematic from the borough’s point of view since the space is still being used to advance higher education. The reason we requested this derogation is because academic buildings require floors that are a little higher than those of the planned residence. The new plan will actually have a smaller footprint than what we planned to build in 2001. The hub will occupy 15% of the existing grassy field (1,300 m² out of the 8,780 m².) 
Will the additional space increase traffic to the area?
While the building extension will add new space to Loyola, the campus population is expected to expand by only 230 people - faculty members and students. This increase is expected to create a demand for a mere 54 additional parking spaces, which campus parking lots can easily absorb. We will also intensify our campaigns on campus to encourage use of public transportation.
Will this affect the amount of sunlight I receive or affect my garden?
The expansion will not be built close to properties in the adjoining neighbourhood. Sunlight will not be affected.
About the construction
What is the project timeline?
We anticipate the public call for tender relating to construction to go out in early 2018. Construction is expected to begin in the spring of 2018 and expected to be complete by the spring of 2019. 
Will the construction be noisy?
Like any construction zone, noise may be a factor. However, we will do our best to minimize noise. In keeping with municipal regulations, work is not expected to take place between 9 p.m. and 7 a.m., Monday to Friday, and between 5 p.m. and 8 a.m. on Saturday and Sunday.
Will construction affect the flow of traffic near Loyola?
This project is in its very early stages. The construction delivery and transportation planning will be established with the General contractor prior to construction work. We are sensitive to the issue and will work to minimize disruption and keep our neighbours well informed throughout the process. 
I currently walk my dog on Loyola campus. Will it be safe during construction?
The construction zone will be completely fenced in for the protection of the university community and the public. Restricted access areas will be well identified. 
About the project
Why is new space needed?
This project is needed to provide our scientific community with new state-of-the-art research facilities and specialized equipment to further their research goals. The new building, for which we are aiming for a LEED Gold certification, has been strategically designed to physically connect researchers between spaces and encourage interdisciplinary collaboration. The interdisciplinary work that our researchers are doing and their ability to partner with industry will help solve real problems facing our communities in fields such as agriculture, health and sustainability. 
Who is funding this project?
The project is made possible through funding from the federal government’s Post-Secondary Institutions Strategic Investment Fund (SIF) and the Quebec government’s Plan québécois des infrastructures . Concordia is also contributing to the project.
Who will occupy the space?
The space will house researchers from a wide range of disciplines studying a variety of topics, including biology, chemistry, biochemistry, engineering, health and sustainability.  One of the goals of this project is to foster interdisciplinary collaboration between our researchers. The research being conducted in the new hub will be closely connected to the work being done in the science building. Students and researchers need to share equipment and work in close proximity.
About the borough approval
Is the borough aware of this project?
Yes. The borough approved our master plan in 2001, which included future growth in this location. We made the borough aware of this specific project in 2016 and have been working closely with its officials throughout the process.
Will this project require any zoning changes?
No. It will require a modification of the landscape and building guidelines that were approved in our master plan in 2001.
What modifications need to be made to the building guidelines?
In 2001, when we received permission for our master plan, we did not know exactly what we would need or how the structure would look. We now know we need four usable above-ground storeys, a top-story mechanical room and an additional basement. We know the type of materials that will be used, the ratio of windows that will be required and no longer require a loading dock. As such, the modifications that are required for this project relate to the height of the building, the materials, the fenestration ratio and the absence of a loading dock.
Have residents been involved in the planning for this project and what recourse exists if they have concerns?
Our relationship with our neighbours is important to us and our goal is always to have an open line of communication with them. We invited our campus neighbours to an information session on July 19 to provide them with a forum to learn more about the project and ask questions.
Expanding on the Richard J. Renaud Science Complex, the science hub will have four storeys plus a mechanical level and two basements and is targeting LEED Gold certification. The new facilities will house state-of-the-art laboratories and research spaces physically connecting our research communities to encourage interdisciplinary collaboration and foster innovation.
The space will house researchers from a wide range of disciplines studying a variety of topics, including biology, chemistry, biochemistry, engineering, health and sustainability. This space will allow researches to partner with next-generation industry to help solve real problems facing our communities.
The Science Hub will have a smaller footprint than what was planned for in 2001 and will occupy only 15% of the existing grassy field. The surrounding space will be landscaped to improve the biomass of the field. At maturity, the benefits of the new biomass will actually be six times greater than if we left it as mere grass.
The new landscaping is designed to improve the quality of life for students and nearby residents with outdoor living spaces for work, relaxation and meditation. Some 40 trees will be planted to provide shade and create tree-lined pedestrian and vehicle corridors.
