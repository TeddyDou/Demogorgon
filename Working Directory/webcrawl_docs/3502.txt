About Us
The Concordia Undergraduate Journal of Art History (CUJAH) is a student-run association that aims to showcase the talents of Concordia University’s undergraduate Art History and Fine Arts students by means of an annual journal publication and  conference event. CUJAH strives to provide students with academic and professional opportunities through workshops, events, and online resources. CUJAH is composed of an executive team, an editorial team, a design team and is assisted by faculty members in the Department of Art History.
As a journal, we strive for academic excellence. CUJAH only selects essays for our published volumes which have received an A- or A+ letter grade from an undergraduate Art History or Fine Arts class at Concordia University. We have been publishing for 13 years now, since 2004-2005, and have recently released our 13th edition (April, 2017). Over the past year. In addition to the publication of our annual journal, CUJAH will be hosting its 7th Annual Undergraduate Art History Conference.
Objectives:
To encourage Fine Arts undergraduate students to participate and produce a peer-edited academic journal, as writers and/or editors.
To promote Concordia University’s Faculty of Fine Arts across Canada and in Montreal. To provide other universities and communities with material for promotion and learning about the talent that is coming out of Concordia University.
To encourage Fine Arts undergraduate students to put forth their best academic work within their Art History classes with the intention of having their work published in CUJAH. This offers an opportunity to participate in art historical discourse within a formal context.
To offer Fine Arts undergraduate students the opportunity to improve their CV, allowing for the opportunity to enter into graduate studies or the job market, having experienced the process of peer-editing in an academic context, or having been published online and/or in print.
Funding: 
As a FASA Affiliate, the CUJAH raises its own fee levy in the Faculty of Fine Arts. We are funded by all undergraduate Fine Arts students through a fee levy of $0.12 per credit. As such, our publications, events, and workshops are free of charge for Fine Arts students and for the Concordia community at large.
