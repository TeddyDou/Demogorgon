The Politics of Dance
Ten years ago, in the Summer 2007 issue, Shannon Litzenberger, then executive director of the Canadian Dance Assembly, wrote a column about the dance community and the federal government, “Coping with the Conservatives: CDA reflects on a year of cultural policy under Canada’s new government.” The Dance Current asked current executive director Kate Cornell to comment on the changes over the past decade and the relationship with the Trudeau Liberal government. By Kate Cornell
Review
On Double-Touch and Performing Objects
META showcases Deanna Peters’ unabashed personal style and, with collaborators Justine A. Chambers and Kim Sato, explores the complexity of the human body and its potential for connectivity within and without its physical limits. The work delves into its topic from two angles: exploring the human body first, then placing it in relationship to objects and other bodies. By Rachel Maddock

A Cosmic Kind of Minimalism
When introducing her new work, Andrea Nann is direct and affecting and serves to recast the stage as an “outer space” – a place between celestial bodies and also human ones. The work is part of DanceWorks 40th anniversary season. By Molly Johnson
News
A Tale of (Residency in) Two Cities
In the past few years, two of Canada’s most prominent contemporary dance companies have been shifting their perspective away from the traditional company structure, and the resulting expectations, toward creation hubs. The idea is to serve the evolving needs of the choreographic community. Now, Dancemakers Centre for Creation and Centre de Création O Vertigo (CCOV) are teaming up to create a cross-city artistic bridge between Toronto and Montréal.
Feature
Choreographing Community
“You have to almost fall out of love before you’re going to open up to other possibilities,” recalls Karen Jamieson, of her journey into community-engaged dance. A Canadian pioneer of the practice, Jamieson shares with Brittany Duggan how this practice spread through Vancouver and how it was “utterly different from professional dance” as she had previously known and practised it. By Brittany Duggan
Column
