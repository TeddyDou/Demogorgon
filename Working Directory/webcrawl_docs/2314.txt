Research
Behavioral and neuroendocrinological studies of maternal behavior, food intake, diet selection and their relationship to reproductive state.
Overview: The major goal of my research program is to use a rat model to explore the complex interaction of neural, endocrine and behavioral processes that enable female mammals to successfully meet the challenge of pregnancy and lactation. Elucidating these mechanisms is clearly important for understanding the physiology and behavior of pregnant and lactating mammals and there is sufficient overlap among species that some of our findings may relate to human and non-human primates, as well as to other rodents. In addition, pregnancy and lactation are transient states, and the mechanisms that are recruited during these states which in some instances reflect profound changes in brain neurochemistry and morphology, are also transient. Thus, investigating these mechanisms and the circumstances that are necessary and sufficient to induce them provides an opportunity to study the plasticity of brain mechanisms and their control.
