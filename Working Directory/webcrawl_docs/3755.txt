What is CMC?
JMMA's Creative Marketing Conference (CMC) is a day dedicated to explore the quintessential aspect of creativity in marketing. Our goal is to connect marketing enthusiasts with professionals that offer a valuable learning experience through their keen insights and unique approach to marketing needs.
CMC will pioneer what conferences in this day and age should be like. CMC attendees  will  not only learn about areas of creative marketing, but above all, they will have the opportunity to experience them. We will create an interactive environment that incorporates technology, encourages meaningful connections, and offers access to information in real-time. We want attendees to see CMC as the benchmark of what conference should be like by stimulating their creativity.
To top it off, CMC also offers JMMA's Cutthroat Marketing Game, speaker panels, workshops and a networking cocktail.

How is CMC different?
It is not uncommon to sit through a conference for 8 hours, trying really hard to absorb every piece of information spoken by keynote speakers. Growing up as millennials, we know this isn't the best way to learn, interact or stimulate creativity. So JMMA decided to challenge the status quo and decided to create a whole new benchmark for what conferences should be like. At JMMA's Creative Marketing Conference (CMC), we will have a game called Cutthroat Marketing, instead of a case competition; we will have interactive speaker panels, where audiences can engage with speakers; we will offer workshops to get hands on learning; and introduce a different way of networking. Experience how conferences should be like and stimulate your creativity.
How is it priced?
We understand that you may not be able to attend the full conference so you can attend the parts of the conference without paying for the full day.
Note that the day is separated in three, 1) Cutthroat Marketing, 2) Speaker Panels & Workshops, 3) Networking Cocktail.
Packages
1) All three for $40
2) Speaker Panels, Workshops and Networking cocktail for $30
3) Only Speaker Panel & Workshops for $25
