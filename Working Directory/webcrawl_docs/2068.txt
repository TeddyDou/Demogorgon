Chemistry (BSc)
Bachelor of Science (BSc)
Offered by:
Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why study Chemistry?
Play with atoms. Make molecules. Explore the building blocks of matter that are at the root of all sciences. Peer into the microscope for an intimate look at the behaviour and energy of the tiniest elements in the universe. As a chemist, your mastery of chemical reactions could lead to the creation of environmentally friendly materials like compostable plastics or medications that fight disease.
Our Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry features state-of-the-art labs and equipment that introduce you to techniques used in the field. Small class sizes foster strong student–professor relationships. Both Chemistry and Biochemistry students follow a core curriculum and through labs, lectures and tutorials you will:
Receive a solid foundation in carbon-based (organic) and non-carbon (inorganic) chemistry
Learn to identify compounds, analyze the structures they form, and study the mechanics and energetics of chemical reactions
Receive extensive training in research methodology
Perform original research as an undergraduate (honours and specialization students only)
Our honours and specialization in Chemistry programs are accredited by the Ordre des chimistes du Québec.
Program details
Degree options
A Bachelor of Science degree takes a minimum of three or four years (90–120 credits) of full-time study,  depending on your academic background .

Registration
Each student will receive a package of information regarding the Registration process, which includes the registration dates. Students must see a Department Advisor who will help in choosing the courses and planning their programme. Unless you are a returning student it is mandatory to have an advisor approve your courses before Registration. You must make an appointment with an advisor:
Telephone: (514) 848-2424, Ext. 3355
Make sure you bring a copy of your academic record and your letter of admission when you meet the advisor.
The normal course load for a full-time student is 30 credits for the academic year (Note: enrolling in less than 24 credits in an academic year will make a student ineligible for many scholarships, bursaries and loans).
To request permission for a course overload, course substitution or to take a course without the required prerequisite, a student must obtain a Departmental Student Request form from SP-201.01. When the form has been filled in and the appropriate documents attached, it should be given to the Receptionist in room SP-201.01.
Please read the Undergraduate Calendar for deadlines ( Section 11 ) and regulations ( Section 16 ) regarding course changes, withdrawals, etc. Make sure that you understand the Degree Requirements ( Section 31.003 ) and Academic Performance Regulations ( Section 31.003.1 ) for the Faculty of Arts and Science.
Financial information
A number of scholarships and prizes are available to students in the Department. Some of these are awarded before starting the program of study at Concordia, such as, Entrance Scholarships, while others are awarded during the course of studies, such as, In-Course Scholarships.
There are also Federal and Provincial Loans and Bursaries for eligible candidates. Further information is available in  Section 18.6  of the Undergraduate Calendar.
Co-op program
The Chemistry Co-op program gives you the chance to complete paid work terms that last 12 to 16 weeks. As a Co-op student, you will work for firms where you may:
Develop new chemical processes used to make drugs
Extract, purify and perform quantitative analysis on metabolites in biological samples
Conduct tests to predict long-term performance of adhesives
Learn more about our Co-op program.
Science College
Concordia University's Science College provides a unique forum where students interested in the sciences can prepare for a life of research, teaching or any challenging pursuit or profession in the sciences.
Founded in 1979, the Science College espouses the following well-defined, distinct, and important concepts of science education: student participation in laboratory research activities from the first year on and a curriculum emphasizing cross-disciplinary thinking as well as intensive student-faculty and student-student interaction.
Find out more about the Science College .
Exchange programs
Reactive Intermediates Student Exchange (RISE)
RISE is a summer student exchange program providing undergraduate students with opportunities to carry out original research and gain hands-on experience in the use of modern instrumental and other experimental techniques. The RISE Group is a collection of scientists at almost twenty institutions in Canada, whose research emphasizes the study of chemical or biochemical reaction mechanisms. Read more about the RISE program .
Inorganic Chemistry Exchange (ICE)
ICE offers summer employment opportunities to 12 qualified candidates from across Canada. The awards are for a summer research assistantship at an institution other than your own, in the laboratory of an ICE faculty member. Read more about the ICE program .
After your degree
An undergraduate degree in chemistry also paves the way for future graduate studies or can lead to a career in environmental science, pharmaceuticals, nanotechnology, biotechnology or government testing laboratories or chemical industries.
