How to meet our students
Looking for interactive and innovative ways of getting closer to the JMSB community? The following options can help your organization be more visible on campus, even if you do not have immediate job openings available. They can be terrific opportunities for branding your organization while networking with prospective future candidates.
Career Fair
This signature event is an excellent opportunity for employer partners to identify potential candidates from undergraduate and graduate levels. The Career Fair is our flagship event and is attended by over 600 students annually from various programs and levels. 
Company Tours
Open your doors for a group company tour. This encourages our students/alumni to experience a typical work day while allowing you to network with attendees in an informal setting. 
Industry Panel Presentations
Appoint a member of your organization to join other business professionals for an industry-related panel discussion conducted in front of a group of JMSB students/alumni. The goal is to discuss career-related topics in your industry.
Information or Recruitment Sessions
Organizations conduct on-campus presentations to discuss their specific industry and hiring needs. Our Career Management Services team will work with you to determine an optimal information session schedule. 
Guest Speakers
Invite a member of your organization to be a guest speaker at a special event which targets specific student groups (e.g. finance/accounting etc.). Increase your organizations’ on-campus presence while providing students/alumni with valuable knowledge on career and/or industry-related topics. 
Partnering with the JMSB community
JMSB has a wealth of active student groups who are always looking to implicate organizations into their networking activities. In addition, JMSB is internationally renowned for our case competitions at both the graduate and undergraduate levels. Contact us to inquire about being a sponsor and/or a judge!
