Educational Studies (MA)
Master of Arts (MA)
Offered by:
Department of Education , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why pursue a Master's in Educational Studies?
The MA in Educational Studies (ESTU) focuses on education for alternative possibilities, with a strong commitment to social justice, critical reflection, and putting theory to work in the world. Drawing from disciplines like sociology, philosophy, anthropology, and history, an emphasis on critical theoretical approaches is combined with a policy analysis component as well as a significant international orientation. You have the opportunity to develop a diverse set of research skills with a particular emphasis on the qualitative research skills necessary to analyze complex educational problems with insight and depth. You will leave the program well-positioned to become critical professionals who are equipped to influence policy and practice in a variety of educational settings.  In addition, students applying to the MA in Educational Studies may select an Adult Education concentration option.
Our faculty members have published in a multitude of prestigious journals, such as the International Journal of Self-Directed Learning, Cultural and Pedagogical Inquiry, the International Journal of Qualitative Studies, Comparative Education Review, and Education and Society.  They have also held editorial positions in several national and international journals most recently in the leading Philosophical Inquiry in Education (PIE), published by the Canadian Philosophy of Education Society.  Authors of multiple books and invited speakers at conferences around the world, our researchers have served as chairs for various societies and symposiums, and received the highest honours from various disciplinary associations.
Join a diverse student body, originating from Québec, Canada and internationally, that is comprised of working professionals, educators and administrators in public and private schools, business and advertising managers and nurse educators among others.  Many of these students continue to obtain their doctoral degrees after the completion of the program. The diversity of our students and faculty guarantees an interdisciplinary and enormously rich experiential context in which to study towards an MA degree.
