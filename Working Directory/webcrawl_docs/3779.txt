Mentorship Program
With a new year comes the opportunity to gain a competitive edge. It could be challenging to stand out from the crowd while firms are scouting Montreal’s top talent as future accounting professionals. The John Molson Accounting Society is offering their support to help you improve your interpersonal skills, extracurricular evolvement and overall confidence when applying for future employment. Our team wants to assist you in achieving your highest potential. Once you sign up for the Mentorship Program you will be paired with a mentor. As a team, JMAS has selected several mentors to guide you and answer any questions and/or concerns you might have. Our mentors are well rounded, approachable students who have successfully been recruited by firms. Your mentor will work closely with you and suggest ways in which you can enhance your resume and they can also offer professional advice to insure you stay on the right path to a successful career.
It might seem a little too early! However we can assure you the semester will fly by quickly, you need to insure yourself enough time prepare for the recruitment process. So let us help you get ahead start! Joining the Mentorship Program now will offer you more time to improve and strengthen your skills. The John Molson Accounting Society’s Mentorship Program is a great way to network with other students and potentially build long term relationships. We encourage you to sign up and participate. Recruitment can be a tremendously confusing period and JMAS is here to make it a little easier.
Signups will be available in 2018.
