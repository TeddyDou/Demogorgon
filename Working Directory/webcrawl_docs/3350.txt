Go to the EV security desk and ask for the KEY# of the edit suite you reserved rather than the room#.
Use your NETNAME info (MyConcordia) to log on the Computer. Do not store personal files on the computer desktop, documents etc. they will be erased at log out.*
Close to the end of your shift you can add up to TWO hours your booking at the time if no one is schedule after you.
At the end of your shift return the key to the EV security desk. Never pass the key to the next person yourself. The transfer of keys and responsibility belongs to the EV security desk.
