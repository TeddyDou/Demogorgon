Harriet Petrakos's Explore Concordia page
Dr. Petrakos is a school psychologist whose research interests center on   the reciprocal influences of home and school on children's development.   Children's social, emotional and cognitive outcomes are studied across   different contexts (home, school, community). Her research on family   relationships focuses on parent-child dyadic interactions (i.e., verbal   and physical exchanges, initiations and responsiveness, directiveness   and encouragement of autonomy). Her research on family-school   collaboration examines the variability in belief systems between   settings (home, school) and their effects on children's behavior and   academic performance. More specifically, parent-teacher interactions,   teacher-child relationships and peer socialization experiences are   examined as promoting resiliency or risk for children and their   families.
