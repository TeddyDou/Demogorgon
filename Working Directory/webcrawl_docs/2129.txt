Theological Studies (BA)
Bachelor of Arts (BA)
Offered by:
Department of Theological Studies , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why choose Theological Studies?
We attract practicing Christians, non-theists, searchers seeking new horizons, or traditionalists studying cultural heritage. By interacting with other belief systems and staying open to diverse interpretations of the Bible, you’ll reflect on your own beliefs and deepen your intellectual understanding of religion.
Theological Studies gives you the tools to have an informed discussion about God, and to address the 21st-century challenges transforming religious faith. You learn creative scholarly methods to examine classical and contemporary theology historically, philosophically, and scripturally. Theology will intersect with the social sciences and other humanist disciplines. You’ll pursue your own theological quest and goals through six areas within Theological Studies:
Biblical studies
History of Christianity
Christian ethics
Systematic theology
Spirituality
Church and state relations
Our program gives you concrete tools and skills to engage in many different professions: teaching, research, pastoral ministry, government or non-government positions. It also opens doors to graduate studies.
