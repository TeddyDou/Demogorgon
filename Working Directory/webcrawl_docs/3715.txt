BTCUSD Perspective And Levels: Runaway Train?
BTCUSD update: New all time highs as I write this, right into the 8250 target area. The next level to watch for is 8500 which is the top boundary of the reversal zone.  Yesterday I updated my previous BTC report, pointing out that price was in the process of breaking out of the bull flag formation and on its way to 8k. This price action is very clear and very ...

Dash How to Trade
If we look at the daily chart of Dash, we can see a pennant chart pattern. If the price breaks the resistance line of this pattern, it will be realized as a continuation one.  We'll be able to buy based on a breakout signal or place pending orders above 500.00 resistance level. But if we look at 2 important indicators like MACD and DMI, we have to note that their ...

AUDUSD: Next Tradable area
Hello friends,  I highlighted the next potential support area for the pair as i see it. This is not a confirmed support as we don't know if the price will respect it. However, i will keep my eyes wide open if we reach there for a quick counter trend long trade(Wait for a rejection on the lower time frame).  Best Technician

BTC - Consolidation, New Highs and How the CME will Effect Price
Bitcoin' has defied a corrective move which is overdue by normal theories since it's 2015 bull breakout. I gave up looking for this monster to correct, sometimes you just have to throw in the towel.  To boot the last move couldn't be more bullish.  The extensions and targets are crazy at this point, but well within reach. $9400-$9600 could be the next level and ...

FED RESERVE 2.0 meets Mt. Gox 2.0
Please be weary and aware of the sandbox you are playing in.  The prices of not only bitcoin, but cryptos in general are being manipulated by exchanges via Tether.  Tether is not redeemable for USD but it certainly masquerades as the dollar. Even following the dollars mantra...  endless money printing with little to no concern about its effect on our crypto ...

Bitcoin (BTCUSD): It's Pullback Time
Previously, we anticipated a correction from $7200 to at least $6740: https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/6RDA1p7h-Bitcoin-BTCUSD-Correction-To-Be-Continued/ Notice just how accurately the price reversed from POC level on this chart @5684. Now it's time for another pullback, the conditions are met. There are two resistance clusters: the first @8070-8090 and ...

A Golden Monster Trade?
Currently price is trading at the edge of a major classic fibo support. If we can stay above this level ($157) it could trigger a bullish rally taking out resistance levels along the way. AB=CD harmonic pattern suggests trading is to be expected above $577 within the next 19 days. Thus, MIN TP can be set at the $677 fibo extension, and its possible to look higher ...
