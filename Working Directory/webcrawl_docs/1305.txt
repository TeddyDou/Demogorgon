FAQ for self-renewals
Who can renew an item?
Concordia undergraduate and graduate students, faculty (including Retired and Visiting faculty), librarians and staff in good standing may renew items themselves through the library catalogue. Concordia students must be currently registered and staff/faculty members must be employees of Concordia University.
Self-renewals can also be made by persons who hold a valid BCI or OCUL card or an Extramural Borrower's Library Privilege Card.
How do I renew an item online?
You don't need to come into the library to renew checked out material. Follow these basic steps:
Access My Library Account
Login with your Concordia netname and password OR enter your name, barcode and Library PIN
Click on the "Renew All" button to renew all of the items you have borrowed OR select only those items you want to renew by checking the box next to the relevant item and click on the "Renew Selected Items" button
Note: If all your checked out items are automatically renewed after you have signed into your My Library Account (without you selecting anything or clicking update selected button), you are most likely using a bookmark with these specific preferences. Try logging in from My Library Account on the Library Catalogue home page.
Why was my renewal refused?
Please note that a number of different conditions will prevent items from being renewed, for instance:
the item cannot be renewed (for instance, a Reserve item)
another borrower has placed a request on the item
your circulation record has expired
you have an outstanding fine of $5 or more ($20 for faculty)
Inability to renew an item via the self-renewal process does not waive the Libraries' right to apply   fines.
How soon can an item be renewed?
Items can be renewed at any time during the loan period. Users should keep in mind, however, that items can only be    renewed a limited number of times.
How many renewals are allowed?
For detailed information on borrowing, including the number of  renewals, please check our Borrowing and Renewing  page for your specific user group.  
What types of material that can be renewed?
Self-renewals are accepted for most types of materials that can be checked out, except for:
Reserve material
Laptops and tablets
Items on which another patron has placed a HOLD.
