Research interests and current projects
Dr. McDonough’s current research projects are exploring the role of social factors in English L2 speakers' ability to benefit from the learning opportunities that occur during task-based interaction. This work explores how an interlocutor's verbal and non-verbal cues affect whether learners attend to the accuracy of their speech. She is also carrying out a series of writing studies in both ESL and EFL settings to identify the benefits of collaboration for the learners’ writing and linguistic development.
