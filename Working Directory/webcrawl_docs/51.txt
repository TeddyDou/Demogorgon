Colleges, Schools and Institutes
Some of the most important learning happens in intimate settings where students and teachers can gather in their own space to exchange and learn, and to organize and take part in special interest seminars and guest lectures. Concordia University’s Faculty of Arts and Science has three colleges, two schools and two institutes: seven outstanding units that prove that good things do come in small packages.
