Experience the rewards of giving back to your alma mater

The Board of Directors of the  Concordia University Alumni Association  (CUAA) is responsible for all the association's finances, policies and activities.
The Board holds four evening meetings and one annual general meeting per year. Board members are invited to chair or sit on one or more committees and to participate in one strategic planning session per year. Directors are encouraged to represent the CUAA at various alumni and student events.

Chapters around the world
We need volunteers to help us with events in our alumni chapters around the world . It's a great opportunity to meet alumni in your area as well as a meaningful way to give back to your alma mater.

Homecoming class champions
We're looking for class reunion leaders to coordinate Homecoming 2017 for:
Loyola Class of 1967, gold anniversary
Sir George Williams Class of 1967, gold anniversary
Concordia Class of 1992, silver anniversary
Weâ€™re also looking to hear from alumni and students that associate with the LGBTQ community, as well as individuals involved in the La Ville en Rose conference on lesbian and gay studies in 1992.
Loyola Campus is wrapping up its centennial anniversary and we want to celebrate with our alumni at Homecoming 2017. All Loyola alumni are invited to contact us if you wish to take part in these festivities.
