Finals can be stressful. And while there are lots of ways to beat exam stress , from exercise to meditation, is there anything more comforting than a furry friend with a wagging tail?
In November and December, the Webster Library and  Georges P. Vanier Library  will welcome several pet-therapy dogs from the Blue Ribbon Canine Centre  to help students relax.
Webster Library (outside LB-237)
Wednesday, November 22 – 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.
Tuesday, November 28 – 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.
Vanier Library (outside VL-101)
Thursday, November 30, – 12 to 2 p.m.
Wednesday, December 6 – 12 to 2 p.m.
Similar sessions have been held successfully at McGill University; the University of California, Berkeley; the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; the University of Wisconsin; and Yale University to help reduce anxiety and lift spirits.
Concordia's own therapeutic furry friend visits were featured on CBC in spring 2016 .
All of the dogs have been vaccinated and will be on four-foot leashes.
