Workshops & courses
Concordia promotes continuous learning for staff and faculty by offering a large array of professional development courses.
In addition to the workshops and courses offered by Human Resources and other departments of the university, there are many other opportunities for learning and development available. Take a look at what Concordia has to offer below.
The Learning and Development calendar
The Human Resources department's Learning and Development Calendar offers employees opportunities to enhance their skills throughout their careers at Concordia. All the workshops and courses promote professional and personal growth among managers and employees at the university.
The 2017 new curriculum is the result of a survey that was conducted in 2014 to identify our employees’ professional development requirements. Check it out on the Training and Professional Development Cspace page (login required).
Additional Workshop and course options
Centre for Teaching and Learning
In November of 2014, Concordia launched a new Centre for Teaching and Learning (CTL) primarily used by faculty members who teach courses. The CTL offers a broad range of services to both full-time and part-time faculty as well as graduate students, teaching assistants and staff, including workshops on blended learning and teaching technologies, one-on-one consultations, new faculty orientations and seminars in university teaching. Professional development services at a personal and departmental level are also available on demand. For more information please visit the CTL’s Cspace page .
Employee Assistance Program (EAP)
The Employee Assistance Program (EAP) offers free seminars addressing a variety of issues in order to help employees attain a better quality of life. For more information regarding EAP upcoming seminars and to register, please visit the EAP Cspace page .
IT training
Concordia provides IT training to faculty, staff and students. Training is delivered through instructor-led workshops, online materials, demos and individual lessons. Training sessions can also be closed (arranged for groups at time convenient for them) or customized (our standard courses with customization for a particular audience). Workshops range from the basic to advanced levels in applications such as MS Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook), Dreamweaver, Photoshop, and Moodle Learning Management System.
For more information regarding IITS upcoming courses and to register, please visit the IITS web page .
Also, you can visit the Microsoft web page for free training.

Emergency management training
The Office of Emergency Management is committed to promoting emergency preparedness and offers several training programs designed to better prepare individuals to deal with emergency situations both at home and in the workplace and most of our courses are open to the general public.
CERT Orientation Training
The Concordia Emergency Response Team (CERT) is composed of staff and student volunteers who are trained to assist during emergency situations that occur on campus. CERT members are trained to assist during building evacuations and other emergencies that could occur at Concordia.  The four (4) hour orientation session provides knowledge of the role and responsibilities of CERT members during an emergency and how to respond to different emergencies on campus.
