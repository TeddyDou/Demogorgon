Research interests
Our lab works toward elucidating the ecological and evolutionary drivers of biological diversity on Earth. We borrow concepts and tools from community  ecology and biogeography to try and gain a mechanistic understanding of the  emergence, distribution and maintenance of diversity. To accomplish this, we  conduct observational and experimental field studies and compile comprehensive  databases on the distributions, ecological characteristics and evolutionary  history of species.
