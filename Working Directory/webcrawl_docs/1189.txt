Innovation in artistic process and expression is at the heart of the many initiatives being explored in the art, design and performance laboratories in the Faculty of Fine Arts.
While the term 'laboratory' is more common in the sciences, it has been embraced by researcher-creators and scholars in a university context to indicate an emphasis on experimentation, collaboration and interdisciplinarity, leading to new processes, creative communities and innovative works or prototypes.
Research labs in Fine Arts include:
ARTHEMIS , which investigates the evolution of film and moving image studies led by Martin Lefebvre (Mel Hoppenheim School of Cinema);
Global Emergent Media Lab , a unique research platform centered on the critical study of global new media led by Joshua Neves (Mel Hoppenheim School of Cinema);
matralab , a research space that uses interdisciplinary art practice to bridge the gap between emerging art forms led by Sandeep Bhagwati (Music / Theatre);
Obx Labs , where researchers provide both the inspiration and the means for others to push the boundaries of computationally-based expression led by Jason Edward Lewis (Design and Computation Arts);
Senselab, an international network of artists and academics, writers and makers from a wide diversity of fields, working together at the crossroads of philosophy, art and activism let by Erin Manning (Mel Hoppenheim School of Cinema / Studio Arts);
Topological Media Lab , a trans-disciplinary atelier-laboratory for collaborative research and creation in movement arts, speculative architecture and experimental philosophy led by Michael Montanaro (Contemporary Dance);
XS Labs , a design research studio with a focus on innovation in the fields of electronic textiles and reactive garments led by  Joanna Berzowska (Design and Computation Arts).
Other Fine Arts researchers work as part of the Post-Image and Textile and Materiality clusters at the Milieux Institute for Arts, Culture and Technology .
