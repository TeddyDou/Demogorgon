Graduate funding
Financial resources for graduate students
A variety of funding is available to Concordia graduate students. You will find these awards funded by either  internal sources  (Concordia University and its donors), or  external sources  (government and industry). 
This represents just a small sample of opportunities available to you as a graduate student. We strongly encourage you to explore alternate sources. When searching for additional funding for your degree, be sure to search:
Government financial aid  
Work-study program  
Mobility Bursary Program
Eligibility
New students (applying for admission to a Master’s or Doctoral program) are now automatically considered for all  Internal Awards ; there is no separate application process.
Current students may apply for select awards disbursed through  open competitions held by the Faculties or Programs .
Special entrance awards
Concordia offers these prestigious awards to students starting their degree program at Concordia who at the same time will begin receiving full external fellowships/scholarships from a designated provincial (Québec) or federal granting agency.
PhD candidates may receive a Special Entrance Award valued at $10,000 during the first year of tenure of their  External Award .
Master’s level students may receive a Special Entrance Award valued at $6,000 in the first year of tenure of their External Award.
External award recipients are encouraged to contact the School of Graduate Studies  for eligibility criteria and any additional information.
Internal entrance & in-course awards
Entrance awards
Consideration for Entrance Awards is now automatically part of the admissions process for all new students.
In-Course Awards
All students are eligible for these awards.
Current students, registered and in good standing, may apply as long as they meet eligibility requirements. Competitions and deadlines are announced by the Faculties and Programs directly. Applications are made available accordingly.
Other internal funding sources

Concordia Stand-Out Graduate Research Award

Research Assistantships
Many graduate students receive support in the form of a stipend paid by a faculty member holding a research grant. Contact your department  Graduate Program Director  or thesis supervisor for possibilities.
Teaching Assistantships
Faculties typically allocate funds annually to individual departments for teaching assistants, markers, lab demonstrators, conference leaders, etc. Contact your department  Graduate Program Director  for details.
