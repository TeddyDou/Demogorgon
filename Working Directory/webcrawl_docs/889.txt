Controversies surrounding Canada’s 150th anniversary
The celebration of Canada’s 150th anniversary is unfolding in the midst of a series of controversies over how to best remember history. Political leaders in Quebec and Nova Scotia are criticising the CBC television series The Story of Us, for its negative depiction of francophone historical figures as well as its omission of significant events. Meanwhile, the Bank of Canada has unveiled the design for a new ten dollar bill that will feature its selection of prominent Canadians. Ronald Rudin, professor in the Department of History and co-director of the Centre for Oral History and Digital Storytelling, can address the challenges in mounting inclusive historical commemorations.

Anniversary of the U.S. Civil Rights Act
“As the U.S. Supreme Court has scaled back some of the hard won victories of the 1960s’ civil rights movement, and President Trump has voiced antipathy to the views of Black Lives Matter advocates, odds are that civil rights controversies will be back in the headlines before long.” Graham Dodds on the anniversary of the introduction of the Civil Rights Act in the U.S.
