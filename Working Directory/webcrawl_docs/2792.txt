Think about your voting experiences – about receiving your notification in the mail, about ensuring time to get to the voting location, about lining up, about ensuring you are on the list.  And then, there’s the voting booth – paper and pencil, special folds of the ballot, boxes, hand-counts…. Where is the technology?
In this episode, host Francine Pelletier and researcher Jeremy Clark explore issues around technology and voting.

Consider fitness and activity tracking devices (like the popular fitbit), or apps on your phone that help monitor weight, eating habits, exercise, heart rate, blood pressure, glucose levels – even your sleep can be monitored.
In this episode, Francine Pelletier speaks to researchers at Concordia University about the ways body feedback is communicated – and how it can improve our health. The future is about health literacy through self-monitoring. You’re body’s calling, are you listening?

Flying Cars & Jetpacks
Episode 1
Release date: March 15, 2017
Download
Look back at images of what we thought the future might be – you know, images from the 1950s and 60s with people getting around via jetpacks. Futurism has always had a fascination with tranport.
In this episode,  Zachary Patterson talks about how we currently get from Point A to Point B, and how our modes of transportation might change in the future. Will we all be flying around with jetpacks strapped to our backs in 2067? Or is the future of transit on two wheels?

How do we imagine our future? In the 1950s and 60s there was a creative imagining of technology and the future, most of it utopian. Think images of flying cars, cities under glass, helpful cyborgs, aluminum clothing, and personal jetpacks.
Some of these ideas about the future were not so far off – but what inspires our future thinking now? Can we use university research to imagine new possibilities? Can we speculate along with researchers about what’s next?
What’s in your future? This is 2067.
Host: Francine Pelletier
