Felice Yuen's Explore Concordia page
Felice Yuen’s research  focuses on leisure and its impact on the quality of life of individuals and the  communities in which they live. More specifically, she is interested in leisure  as a context for community development and civic engagement for marginalized  populations. Recent research projects include studies exploring the experience  of youth in a gang prevention program using hip hop as medium of data  collection, examining the healing process of Aboriginal women through body  mapping (a form of visual arts), and exploring Aboriginal youth health  leadership through creative play workshops. Her research has been done in collaboration with  community-based organizations such as Minwaashin Lodge (a women’s Aboriginal  support centre), Tyndale St. Georges Community Centre, Community Justice  Initiatives, and the Ontario Lung Association.
During her PhD at the University of Waterloo, she was heavily involved in a  study that examined the reintegration needs of incarcerated women. For more  information on this project, please go to http://www.ahs.uwaterloo.ca/uncertainfutures/ .  Felice has presented at national and  international conferences and was a recipient of a Canada Graduate Scholarship  Award from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.
