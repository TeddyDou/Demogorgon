Our Executive Team
Although we only have a couple of members listed here, Space Concordia is composed of a much larger team of equally passionate people. Our job as executives is to act as ambassadors for the team and to support all Space Concordia members. We're proud and honored to be part of such an amazing team.
We invite members to read through the Space Concordia Constitution. Members are also free to suggest changes to the document.
