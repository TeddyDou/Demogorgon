Office of Student Relations
Learn more about Fine Arts student life activities. We strive to cultivate links between the wider student population and extra-curricular student-run projects, like Art Matters , Café X, Fine Arts Reading Room and the VAV Gallery.
The Office of Student Relations is the link between all student-run projects, the Dean’s Office and the wider university community. Whether you are interested in arts-related governance, gallery direction, festival production, resource centre management and non-profit arts related businesses we are here to help ensure the success of our student-run organizations.
The Student Relations coordinator also oversees Travel Grants to Undergraduate Students, a fund for department-organized exhibitions of student work
