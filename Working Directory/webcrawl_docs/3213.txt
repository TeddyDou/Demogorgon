Want to make new friends across all cultures and majors? Do you like or want to learn about tea? Come join the Concordia University Tea Enthusiast Association (CUTEA)! We're a varied bunch including foodies, eccentrics, connoisseurs, as well as busy students who just want to chill and chat over a delicious cup (or several!) of the world's 2nd most popular beverage. Let's discover new teas and cafés, find the best deals on your favourites, participate in traditional ceremonies from various counties, and have great conversations. Just click here and send a request to join our Facebook group - we're looking forward to meeting you!
