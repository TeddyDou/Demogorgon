Vivek Venkatesh's Explore Concordia page
Vivek Venkatesh is the Associate Dean - Recruitment and Awards at the School of Graduate Studies (July 2017 - July 2018), former Associate Dean - Academic Programs & Development at the School of Graduate Studies (August 2012- June 2015), incoming Director of the Centre for the Study of Learning and Performance (CSLP; January 2018 - January 2022), the inaugural Director of the Graduate Certificate in University Teaching and Associate Professor in the Department of Education at Concordia University in Montréal, Québec.
Venkatesh is a filmmaker, and an interdisciplinary and applied learning scientist who investigates the psychological, cultural and cognitive factors impacting the design, development and inclusive adoption of digital media in educational and social contexts. Venkatesh avails of a vast network of local, national and international collaborators, and works on a series of novel - yet focused - research and research-creation activities including: evaluating innovative techno-pedagogical practices which foster critical dialogues rooted in citizen education and digital literacy within secondary and post-secondary classroom contexts; developing digital media applications to sensitize and prevent online hate speech amongst the general public; and curating live artistic performances which promote resilience to online hate using sounds, texts and visuals collected via mobile and social media. Venkatesh's research program looks at the unique intersection between the areas of learning sciences, public pedagogy and digital media, especially in building interdisciplinary collaborations for projects related to the socio-cultural impacts of the increased use of mobile and social media in the broad context of citizen education.
Since 2008, Venkatesh has employed his advanced expertise in educational technology, cognitive science and sociology on several interdisciplinary, team-based programs of research worth more than $9 million. He has obtained external funding as Principal Investigator or co-Principal Investigator (PI or co-PI) to the tune of over $2 million from international, federal and provincial competitions - and as co-investigator in federal and provincial infrastructure, federal partnership development and team research grants totalling over $7.1 million . Venkatesh’s most recent highlights include being a co-PI on a Norwegian Kroner 3.9 million grant from the Research Council of Norway to investigate visual art, music and film-based pedagogies in science education (2015-2018); the PI on a multi-institutional, multi-national SSHRC Insight Grant - worth over $311,000- exploring information literacy in online learning environments (2014-2018); and the PI on two grants from the Canadian federal department of Public Safety - worth over $550,000 - focusing on the development of public pedagogies in music scenes and the development and evaluation of a web portal to counter hate speech in social media (2014-2019).
