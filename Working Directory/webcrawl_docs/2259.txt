Education
PhD (Université de Montreal)
I am a political scientist and I conduct research on immigration policy and politics in Canada, North America and Australia. I am interested in how political institutions and bureaucracies affect the content of immigration policy. My current projects focus on the new politics of immigration in Canada, the role of immigration departments in contemporary Quebec and Canada and new state responses to emerging immigration challenges.
With Concordia colleagues, I co-founded and co-direct the Centre for Immigration Policy Evaluation (CIPE) . 
In 2017-2018, I am the William Lyon Mackenzie King Postdoctoral Fellow of the Canada Program  at Harvard University's Weatherhead Center for International Affairs. In 2016-2017, I was the recipient of the Concordia University Research Awards ("Person and Society").
To learn more about my work, please visit my website: https://mireillepaquet.net
I am interested in supervising graduate students and honors thesis in the following areas: immigration policies and politics, theories of immigration and integration, policy development and implementation. Je parle français et suis heureuse de superviser des étudiantes et étudiants souhaitant travailler dans cette langue.
Research interests
Public policy and public administration, immigration and integration  (policies and processes), federalism as well as Canadian and Québec Politics.
