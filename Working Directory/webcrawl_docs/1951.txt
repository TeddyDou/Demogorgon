Geography, Urban and Environmental Studies (MSc)
Master of Science (MSc)
Offered by:
Department of Geography, Planning & Environment , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why pursue a Master's in Geography, Urban and Environmental Studies?
Human activities have caused unprecedented levels of environmental change over the past decades. The human environment has also transformed dramatically over this time as more people settle in cities of ever increasing size. Now more than ever, we need experts who are conscious of the interrelation between the human and the physical geographies to collectively engage with these environments in order to bring about large-scale systemic reforms.
The MSc in Geography, Urban and Environmental Studies is located in a collegial learning environment where students develop a broad conception of the environment that is physically, socially, politically and economically constructed. Benefit from an interdisciplinary framework that encourages students in the natural sciences, social sciences and humanities to consider varied perspectives as they carry out in-depth research on a specific area of interest.
Work under the close supervision of research-active faculty members who have published in numerous prestigious journals. Our researchers have also received the highest honours from the Royal Society of Canada’s College of New Scholars and the Canada Research Chairs Program.
Immerse yourself in a diverse region. Montreal and its surrounding areas provide rich sites for fieldwork and analysis, as well as connections to an expansive Francophone network with its own socio-cultural and policy histories.
Join a dynamic cohort of students that includes young scholars and professionals with practical work experience. The research interests of our students cut across multiple fields of human geography, GIS, urban planning, environmental science, government policy and social justice advocacy.
