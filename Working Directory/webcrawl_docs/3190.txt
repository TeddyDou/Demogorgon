Club Description: 
The CMLS is an organization devoted to provide students with the necessary knowledge and practice regarding moot courts to complement their ambitions in Law. The group’s main objective is to give students the chance to learn first-hand what it feels like to be a lawyer and gain valuable experience to prepare for law school and a career in law.
The CMLS is the first of its kind in Concordia university. It will help put our institution on the map when it comes to mooting competitions- a key activity to prepare for law schools and legal careers. It will complement the academic options offered by the institution and will provide students with a platform to network with other future law students from universities across Canada.
