Mature entry
Minimum admission requirements for mature students
If you are over 21 years old and do not meet our normal academic admission requirements, you should consider applying to study at Concordia through the Mature Entry Program (MEP). We consider your eligibility based on your age, experience and potential. The MEP requires the successful completion of a minimum of 18 additional credits.
In order to apply to the Mature Entry Program, you must meet the following conditions:
Be 21 years old by August 1 or December 1 for entry in September or January respectively;
Lack the normal academic requirements for admission, but demonstrate the ability to successfully undertake undergraduate courses;
Have not been engaged in full-time study for at least 24 months since the age of 18. Applicants who have been out of school for 12 months may be admitted provided their academic record for the previous 24 months is favourable;
Be a Canadian citizen or permanent resident.
If you do not qualify as a Mature Student, you may want to investigate the possibility of becoming an Independent Student . To meet an Admissions Information Officer to discuss general admissions information, please call 514-848-2424 ext. 2668 to make an appointment.
