Bioprospecting for the next generation of antibiotics
About the research
Dr. Brandon Findlay  is offering one Scholarship opportunity for a student applying for either an MSc or PhD in Concordia University’s Biochemistry program. The student will focus his/her research attention on natural products; in particular the discovery of new antibiotics.  
The primary objectives of the research project will be to probe the regulatory pathways that Gram-negative bacteria use to control the biosynthesis of their natural product repertoire.  By “hijacking” these processes we will then be able to active silent gene clusters at will, leading to the isolation of compounds with antibiotic activity. Compounds will be tested against a panel clinical pathogens housed in the Findlay lab, to evaluate their potential to serve as part of a new generation antibiotics in the clinic. Through this work the student will become familiar with natural product chemistry, molecular biology, and clinical microbiology.
This research project will be supported by the state-of-the-art facilities at Concordia University, including the Centre for Structural and Functional Genomics (CSFG), the Centre for Biological Applications of Mass Spectrometry (CBAMS) and the BIOFINS platform.
 
Financial Commitment
The selected candidate will receive a generous funding package consisting of a Research Assistantship Bursary, a Teaching Assistantship, and a special Antibiotics Fellowship valued at $10,000 in Year I of their program.  Applicants may also be considered for additional scholarships and bursaries, including tuition remissions.  The total financial package will exceed $26,000 in Year I and $24,000 in the following one (MSc) or three (PhD) years of the program. The financial support can be extended to an additional semester beyond the regular two/four year duration of the program if necessary.
