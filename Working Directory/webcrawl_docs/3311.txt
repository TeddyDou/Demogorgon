Hour 10/48
September 10, 2016
Good morning and welcome to the 48 Hour Animation Challenge.
We’re very impressed with the turnout for this event, we’re very happy that everyone who wanted to participate found a team and we’re very excited to see what everyone creates!
The main idea of this event is to get people together to be part of something we all enjoy; animation.
This is an event for all skill levels, so don’t be shy. There are so many aspects of animation from conception, production to post-production that anyone can be involved in (with or without a super powerful computer).   I’m sure you and your teammates will find a way that everyone can contribute. This is an experience that everyone who shares in will benefit from.
Be resourceful, be smart, and be friendly.
Films may be completed in any medium you choose, so long as they are made over the course of 48 hours. Everything from brainstorming to exporting must be done within the 48 hours, so use your time wisely!
Keep in mind that this is a low-stress event and there is absolutely no pressure to spend all of the 48 hours endlessly working. We encourage you to lead a healthy balanced lifestyle. Ultimately, you do what you want, but sleep is healthy!
Soon after the challenge ends and all the 48 Hour Films are collected, we’ll get back together, screen the films, and decide on the winners through a group voting process. We’ll do this in EV 5.615 @ 7pm on Wednesday (14th).
As you know, Our special sponsor, ToonBoom is offering PRIZES to animators whose films rank 1ST, 2ND, 3RD  place in the challenge
1ST Place: Toon Boom Harmony Premium (1-year license)
2ND place: Toon Boom Harmony Advanced (1-year license)
3RD Place: Toon Boom Harmony Essentials (1-year license)
All members from each of the winning teams will be awarded their 1-year license.
BONUS: As a generous participation prize from our sponsor, all participants of the challenge will receive a free 3 month trial of Toon Boom animation software!
Remember! This is a FRIENDLY COMPETITION. Everyone is a winner here.
To be eligible for these prizes and perks, participants must include their sponsors in the credits of their film.
Special thanks: To give some recognition, please include the logos of the entities that made this opportunity possible, Animate Concordia, FASA, Mel Hoppenheim School of Cinema, and Concordia University. (you’ll be able to easily find those here  http://imgur.com/a/wz0P7   
Of course, you can give thanks to more than that, but that’s the minimum we ask.
The 48hr Film Submission form will be released tomorrow morning (September 11th). In the meantime here are the technical requirements. Aim to have your film smaller than 2 Gb.
Don’t hesitate to contact us with any other questions during the challenge!

KEEPING IN TOUCH
There’s this Cool Hip thing Film Animation students are using called SLACK – a free messaging app for teams.
Similar to an ongoing chatroom, you can set up private “channels” with your teammates to discuss your plans. Beyond the 48 Hour Challenge, students are using Slack to share inspiration, get technical support, and receive feedback from each other. To try it out, just go to https://fman.slack.com/ and sign in! You can use it directly from your browser, or preferably through its nifty desktop or smartphone apps! Check it out!
On a more general note, if you like the idea of keeping in touch with Concordia’s animation community, and all that Animate Concordia has up its sleeves, here’s how you can stay in the loop!

Yay!  More Malignant Remedy characters!
You’ll finally get a glimpse of the governing royal family.
This is supposed to be a painting King Burkhart commissioned of his son Prince Erith (heir to the throne) and his lovely daughter, Princess Lena.  They are both diplomatic souls with a competitive edge.  They have a tendency to teach one another how to self-improve, even if it’s not wanted.  They also have a shared interest in astronomy.  Oh…and did I mention they hold a high regard for each other, and are practically inseparable?
That’s all I can say~
Oh, so you like these characters, eh?  You think they look sweet?  Well that’s too bad…cause their world is about to be turned uPsIdE DoWn~
