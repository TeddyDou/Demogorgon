Teaching statement
“My hope is to expose students to science in a way that they are not familiar with. We are in the midst of a scientific revolution; major discoveries continue to be made that change the way we think about traditional scientific subjects. By using a combination of traditional and outside-the-box teaching methods I try to inspire students to learn not just for the sake of learning but because they are inspired by the material. My lectures aim to blend ‘textbook facts’ with new information. In this way the students will leave Concordia with a cutting edge knowledge base and way of thinking that will help them succeed in whatever endeavor they pursue.”

Current research projects
Our laboratory explores how the immune system is influenced by the autonomic nervous system. There is quite a bit known about how these two systems communicate with each other, but the question of why they communicate with each other is not very well understood. More precisely, what are the advantages to having cross-talk between immune and nervous systems, and what are the disadvantages if this interaction breaks down? The relevance of this research is to increase fundamental knowledge of how the immune system is regulated. Such knowledge can be applied to autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, and can also be used to better understand how acute and chronic stress responses alter immunity. Our research is multidisciplinary, with students coming from the departments of Exercise Science, Biology, Psychology, Chemistry and Biochemistry backgrounds. Key methods include isolation of human white blood cells and plasma, sterile cell culture, cellular analysis of immune function,protein analysis, and proliferation assays. We also employ interventions with human subjects to provoke acute sympathetic responses and measure immune biomarker responses. We have active collaborations on the topics of multiple sclerosis treatment and rehabilitation, biomarker development, immune-genomic expression, and new anti-cancer drug development.
