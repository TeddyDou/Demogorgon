Living Far Away From Home Session
November 29, 2017, 2:30 p.m. – 4 p.m.
In this series of two workshops participants will learn what homesickness is, including its stages and symptoms. A variety of homesickness management strategies will be discussed in a relaxed and informal environment. The workshops will give you an opportunity to share your experiences, your personal challenges and success stories. You will leave equipped with knowledge on how to effectively manage cultural adaptation and maybe even find a friend or two!
Please register in advance for the workshop. (You may register for both workshops in the series).
