Costs
The costs of university are more than just tuition. To plan a budget (and apply for financial assistance if you need it), you need an idea of what your other expenses will be and whether you’ll live on- or off-campus.
How to figure out your costs
Use the tuition calculator to estimate your tuition fees at Concordia.
Select the sample table below that best describes your residency situation to help you estimate your annual costs.
Please contact us if you have any questions about how we calculate these numbers.
