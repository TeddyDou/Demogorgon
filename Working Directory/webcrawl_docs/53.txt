RESEARCH CHAIRS
Home to Canada Research Chairs, Concordia University Research Chairs, and  research centres , our Faculty is recognized nationally and internationally for the high and innovative quality of its individual and team research.
These research strengths are integral to our goal of providing leading-edge graduate education and training in more than 35 PhD and Master’s programs that we offer in the humanities, social sciences, and life sciences.
 
Research Chairs, Endowed Chairs, and Distinguished Professorships enable post-secondary institutions such as Concordia to attract and retain the brightest minds in research and scholarship in a variety of subject areas.
 
These programs can be divided into four categories:
Canada Research Chairs
Canada Research Chairs are funded by the Government of Canada in order to ensure that Canadian universities "achieve the highest levels of research excellence to become world-class research centres in the global, knowledge-based economy."
