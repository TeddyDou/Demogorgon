Courses
Required Courses
The program has a total of 21 credits: 18 credits of required courses, including 9 credits of practical study, and 3 credits as an elective chosen from CPTP 514, 515, 598.
CPTP 501 Connections (3 credits)
Through discussion, readings and papers, students explore ways in which designers and production personnel can participate, collaborate and contribute as full partners in the creation of live performance. Counter-intuitive links are explored in the creation of vibrant and chaotically dynamic works.
CPTP 502 The Art of Proficiency (3 credits)
This seminar focuses on describing the connection between imagination and the production-based realities associated with live performance. Through the analysis of various aspects of production, students look at ways of bridging the gap between inspiration, imagination and originality and their practical application within all aspects of production.
CPTP 503 Aspects of Visual, Aural and Performing Arts (3 credits)
This seminar helps the student develop new perspectives by dealing with the fusion between the student’s present practice and other art forms. Throughout the semester, students meet various practicing artists in their work environment or as guest speakers at the university.
CPTP 511 Practical Study I (3 credits)
Under faculty supervision and based on their previous experience or areas of study, students learn how to apply a large number of creative and practical techniques from a chosen discipline towards achieving a cohesive artistic goal as dictated by current practices in the performing and related live arts. These individual projects must be selected in consultation with the program advisor and approved by the program director.
CPTP 512 Practical Study II (3 credits)
Under faculty supervision and based on their previous experience or areas of study, students expand their language and discourse in the performing arts, focusing on communication and collaboration, while marrying the philosophical and the theoretical with the practical. These individual projects must be selected in consultation with the program advisor and approved by the program director.
CPTP 513 Practical Study III (3 credits)
Under faculty supervision and based on their previous experience or areas of study, this practical study prepares the students both artistically and practically, deepening their insight into the theoretical and practical universes supporting live performance, whether within well-established and traditional artistic disciplines or within innovative and new methods of creation. These individual projects must be selected in consultation with the program advisor and approved by the program director.
CPTP 514 Practical Study IV (3 credits)
Under faculty supervision and based on their previous experience or areas of study, students work alongside professional artists either within the university or in a well-established artistic institution. Students are then given immediate ‘hands on’ access to various aspects of production development, construction and staging processes associated with the most current industry expectation and practice. These individual projects must be selected in consultation with the program advisor and approved by the program director.
CPTP 515 Independent Study (3 credits)
An Independent Study proposal must be supported by a full-time faculty supervisor and approved by and with written permission from the program director (in consultation with the coordinating committee). The student generates a topic to be explored from a specific field relevant to their area of study.
CPTP 598 Special Topics in Creative Practices in Technical Production (3 credits)
Topics may address a wide range of critical fields related to technical production for live performance examining both conventional and non-traditional approaches to dance, music, theatre, as well as other performance or media arts. Subject matter will vary from term to term and from year to year. Students may re-register for this course, provided the course content has changed. Change in content will be indicated by the letter following the number (i.e. CPTP 598A, CPTP 598B etc.)
