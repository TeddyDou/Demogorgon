Club Description: 
Autodidacts Concordia Theatre is a group created in 2015 designed to provide Concordia students of all academic disciplines with a unique opportunity to engage in the art of theatre, regardless of experience, while forging bonds with other students and fostering a sense of community through this collective engagement. The club's main engagement is in creating and producing an entirely student written, produced and acted theatre play at the end of every academic year, which any Concordia student may decide to participate in, but throughout the Fall semesters students will have access to bi-weekly theatre or improv workshops hosted by the club, where they will have the opportunity to explore cold reading, breaking down scenes, how to improvise, and many other theatre-related topics.    
If you have questions or worries, please contact the club through posting on our Facebook page or by emailing our executive staff.
Hope to see you at the meetings!
