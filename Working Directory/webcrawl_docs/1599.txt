Moodle learning management system (LMS)
The Moodle (abbreviation for Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment) learning management system (LMS) is a secure web-based environment used for the development and delivery of course activities and resources. Moodle allows teachers to organize and store course content in a secure web-based environment which their students can access from anywhere at any time. Teachers can post, collect, and grade assignments, administer quizzes, host online discussions, share resources, and more.

Teaching & learning technologies – which software to choose
Which software should you choose?
To help you choose among the various technologies available to support your teaching and learning, consider this chart.
If you want to do the following:
Consider this technology:
Here’s a bit more about the technology
Record the lecture and related slides and images for a traditional class while you’re teaching the class (and make the recording available immediately afterwards to students) through Moodle
Panopto lecture-capture software
Panopto is a brand of software that records classroom lectures and captures related slides and images.  This type of software is especially useful for large lectures.  These recordings provide students who have difficulty following the original lecture with an opportunity to review the class session.  Access is provided to students through Moodle.  When reviewing the recordings, second-language learners have stated that they can catch points missed in the original lecture.  Other students have commented that the recordings are useful resources when studying for quizzes and exams.
Conduct a regular class at the regularly scheduled time but online because (a) I am traveling one or more weeks out of the term, (b) The class is scheduled at an awkward time and many students will have difficulty making class on time each week, or (c) I want to regularly include guests in other locations in the class
Adobe Connect virtual classroom software  
Connect is a software from the Adobe Corporation that lets instructors and students meet online at the same time in a virtual classroom.  In the classroom, instructors can lecture; interact with students through voice, chat, and poll questions; share slides, documents and other resources; and let students work in groups, even though they are located in different places.  Instructors can record the session and make the recording available to students to review later.
“Flip” my class: that is, ask students to complete their readings and view recorded lectures through Moodle before the class session and use class time to work through problem sets or similar activities and answer questions
Camtasia screen capture software
Flipped courses are ones in which instructors record lectures and expect students to view them before the class session, so instructors can use class time to work through problems and exercises or similar application activities.  Access is provided to students through Moodle.
Camtasia is software that allows users to create a video by narrating a Powerpoint slide presentation or use of another screen on a computer and recording the presentation.
Camtasia also lets users edit the recordings so that they can have the most visual and audio impact.
Because it is easy to use, makes recordings, and allows for easy editing of the video and audio tracks, Camtasia is ideally suited for preparing the recordings used in flipped courses.
Communicate regularly with students outside of class throughout the term
Moodle
Moodle is software that lets instructors communicate with students outside of the classroom.  A flexible system, instructors use Moodle for one or more of these tasks: sharing announcements; distributing course-related materials—including recordings for the flipped classroom; submitting student assignments; conducting quick polls; and conducting class-related discussions outside of class time.
FAQ
Student FAQ
How do I access Moodle?
There are two ways to access Moodle:
1. Log into the MyConcordia portal using your Concordia netname and password. In the My Moodle Courses block, select the link to your Moodle course site.

I am a registered student trying to access Moodle but it is not working. What can I do?
In order for the course to be accessible to students on Moodle, teachers must "activate" it.  If you are unable to see the course,  contact your teacher to ensure he/she has activated it.
If you register for the course late, you will need to wait 24 hours after the registration to gain access to the activated course. If the problem persists, contact the Service Desk for assistance.  
Why am I unable to access my course website even though my professor says it is available?
You will have access to all 'activated' Moodle courses 24 hours after registration. Otherwise, make sure that the teacher is using Moodle and has not forgotten to make the course site accessible to students.
If the problem persists, contact the Service Desk for assistance.
