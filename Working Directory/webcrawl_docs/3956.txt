Who are we
Who are we?
ASHRAE Concordia is a student society that is affilated with ASHRAE Montreal as well as ASHRAE International. We provide students plenty of opportunities to share their thoughts with great minds as well as expand their network.
What is ASHRAE?
“The future has already begun. The world is changing, pushed to its limits; nearly at the end of its ability to sustain itself. But the world is elastic; we can recover its balance. The path will not be easy. But you never wanted easy, you want to be the solution.”
The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-conditioning Engineers is a non-profit organization founded in 1894 with more than 54,000 members worldwide today. The Society and its members focus on building systems, energy efficiency, indoor air quality, refrigeration and sustainability within the industry. Through research, standards writing, publishing and continuing education, ASHRAE shapes tomorrow’s built environment today.
Mission
To advance the arts and sciences of heating, ventilating, air conditioning and refrigerating to serve humanity and promote a sustainable world.
Vision
ASHRAE will be the global leader, the foremost source of technical and educational information, and the primary provider of opportunity for professional growth in the arts and sciences of heating, ventilating, air conditioning and refrigerating.
Excellence • Commitment • Integrity • Collaboration • Volunteerism
