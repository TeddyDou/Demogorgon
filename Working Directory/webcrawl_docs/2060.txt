Actuarial Mathematics/Finance (BA, BSc)
Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Science (BSc)
Offered by:
Department of Mathematics & Statistics , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why study Actuarial Mathematics and Finance?
Model the future, solve problems involving risk, and make financial decisions that will affect the futures of corporations, communities and investors. This combined program offers you a direct path to an actuarial career with a financial sector specialization. In the program, you do all the Actuarial Mathematics coursework: studying statistics, probability, and learning mathematical models to solve problems involving uncertainty. Then, you combine accounting, economics and finance courses at the John Molson School of Business, learning to analyze the effects of time, money and risk on building wealth.
Plus, you can complete the Co-op program, working with actuaries who oversee the design, financing, and operation of insurance, pension and other benefit plans. At the end of your degree, you will enter a career field that has a great demand for specialists in actuarial finance. Our programs are provisionally accredited by the Canadian Institute of Actuaries (CIA). Grads gain exemptions to four of the preliminary professional exams of the Society of Actuaries and the Casualty Actuarial Society. Concordia University is designated as a Centre of Actuarial Excellence by the Society of Actuaries.
