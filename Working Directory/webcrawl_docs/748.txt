DOCUMENTING THE POLITICIAN: FROM PARIZEAU TO NADEAU-DUBOIS
November 23, 2017, 1:30 p.m. – 3:30 p.m.
You are invited to join award-winning journalist Francine Pelletier at the Centre for Broadcasting and Journalism Studies (CCBJS) for the lates event in our  Truth and Democracy: Journalism, Politics, and Social Science   conference series.
Interviewing politicians can be a particularly tricky business. Journalists are trained to ask questions to get politicians off ‘message track’ and to dig deeper for the ‘truth’ and the ‘real story’. Politicians are trained to speak to the media in a way that gets their message out, and to deflect or divert questions they do not want to answer. Journalists also want politicians to trust them enough to open up, but are also taught to maintain a distance from their sources in order to be ‘objective’ or ‘fair and balanced’. This relationship can get particularly complicated when a journalist is following a politician over months or years to create a documentary.
Francine Pelletier is an award-winning journalist who has written and directed 11 documentary films, including  Monsieur (2003), about former Quebec premier Jacques Parizeau. She is currently producing a film about Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois. She has worked for many English and French media outlets including La Presse, the  Montreal Gazette  and  Le Devoir . She has been the parliamentary correspondent in Quebec City for Radio-Canada’s Le Point and co-host of CBC’s  The Fifth Estate .
Andrea Hunter is Director of CCBJS and has worked for CBC Radio on national and regional shows for over a decade. She was a producer, on-air contributor and fill-in host of The Roundup, a daily national arts and entertainment program on CBC Radio One. She has also been a producer, reporter, and host on morning and afternoon shows on CBC Radio One in Prince Rupert, Halifax, Vancouver, Victoria and Ottawa.
*Presentations in English. Discussions in French and English.
This event has been organized by the Concordia Centre for Broadcasting and Journalism Studies (CCBJS) and Le centre de recherche interdisciplinaire sur la diversité et la démocratie (CRIDAQ).
