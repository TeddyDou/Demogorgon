Doctor of/Doctorate in Philosophy (Economics)
Master of/Magisteriate in Arts (Economics)
Diploma in Economics
Doctor of/Doctorate in Philosophy (Economics)
Admission Requirements. A Master of/Magisteriate in Arts in Economics from a recognized university with a cumulative GPA of 3.50 or equivalent. Students with a high standing in a master’s degree or equivalent in other fields, such as commerce, mathematics or business administration from a recognized university may be admitted, subject to satisfactory completion of qualifying requirements, if necessary. Students with a BA (honours) or equivalent with high standing in economics may apply for admission directly to doctoral studies.
Proficiency in English. Applicants whose primary language is not English must demonstrate that their knowledge of English is sufficient to pursue graduate studies in their chosen field. Please refer to the  Graduate Admission page  for further information on the Language Proficiency requirements and exemptions.
GRE. While writing the GRE is not required, such scores certainly enhance an application for admission and especially for funding.
Requirements for the Degree
Credits. A fully-qualified candidate entering the program with a master’s degree is required to complete a minimum of 90 credits.
Courses. All PhD candidates must take ten one-term graduate courses (30 credits) selected from the Departmental offerings, six of which must be ECON 612: Microeconomics I, ECON 613: Microeconomics II, ECON 615: Macroeconomics I, ECON 616: Macroeconomics II, ECON 680: Econometric Theory I and ECON 681: Econometric Theory II, plus four program electives. A recognition of past graduate work as partial fulfillment of the course requirements for the PhD degree is at the discretion, and subject to the approval of, the Graduate Program Director and the Dean of Graduate Studies. (See the regulation concerning  transfer credits  in this calendar.) Note: If students have taken courses that are required for the PhD program as part of their MA studies, they must substitute them with a maximum of three directed research courses and electives in order to complete the 30 credits required in the PhD program. The directed research courses are chosen in consultation with the thesis supervisor; they are graded pass/fail and are comprised of independent research work carried out under the direction of the thesis supervisor.
Research Seminar. All candidates must take ECON 806: Doctoral Research Seminar (6 credits) requiring the presentation of a paper. This seminar is intended to aid in the development of a doctoral thesis proposal.
Comprehensive Examinations. All candidates must pass three examinations (6 credits) in the areas of: Microeconomic Theory, Macroeconomic Theory and Econometrics. Each of these examinations is set, read and marked by members of the Department. These examinations must be passed before a student enrols in ECON 806.
Fields of Specialization. Each PhD student must have 2 fields of specialization, either as part of the degree of MA or within the students’ PhD program. In order to do this the student must successfully complete 2 courses from the sequences offered in any of the following fields: Economic Development; Financial Economics; Industrial Economics, International Economics; Labour Economics; Public Economics; or 3 courses in one of Econometrics, Macroeconomics or Microeconomics.
Language Requirement. PhD candidates must pass an examination in French. International students may, with the approval of the Department, replace French with another language in which there exists a sufficiently large economics literature.
Thesis. A candidate who has passed the PhD comprehensive examinations must submit in writing to the Graduate Program Director a detailed proposal of a thesis topic. Candidates proceed to work on the thesis (48 credits) only after obtaining approval of the topic from both the Graduate Studies Committee in the Department and the thesis supervisor.
Academic Regulations
Academic Standing. Please refer to the  Academic Standing  section of the Calendar for a detailed review of the Academic Regulations.
Residence. The minimum period of residence is two calendar years (6 terms) of full-time graduate study beyond the master’s degree, or three calendar years (9 terms) of full-time graduate study beyond the bachelor’s degree for those permitted to enrol for doctoral studies without completing a master’s degree. A period of full-time study, allowed or required by the Department to be spent at another institution with adequate research facilities, may be offered towards partial fulfillment of the residence requirements for the degree of PhD at Concordia University. In each case, the Department must obtain approval of the Council of Graduate Studies.
Time Limit. Please refer to the Academic Regulation page for further details regarding the Time Limit requirements.
Graduation Requirement. In order to graduate, students must have a cumulative GPA of at least 3.00.

ECON 618 Monetary Economics
Prerequisite: ECON 615.
This course includes the theory of money, monetary policy, payment systems, and banking. Among the available models, there will be a particular focus on the New Keynesian model as a framework to analyze monetary policy. Alternative models of money, such as search-theoretic models, are also studied.
ECON 619 Political Economy
Prerequisites: ECON 614 and 615.
This course studies how conflicts of interest are resolved through political institutions in democratic countries. In the first half of the course, tools and models that are useful in the analysis of voting and elections, bargaining in legislatures, and special interest politics are studied. In the second half, these tools are applied to examine: (1) how macroeconomic polices are made through the political process; (2) why inefficient policies may be chosen in the end; and (3) how constitutions (indirectly) shape public policy and consequently the economic outcomes of nations.
Economic Development and Planning

ECON 623 Growth and Development
Prerequisites: ECON 501, 503 and 525; or equivalent.
This course examines a series of models that are relevant to the study of economic growth and development. These two issues are studied from a macroeconomic perspective; that is, emphasis is placed on highly stylized models characterized by rational decision making within a dynamic environment.
ECON 624 Topics in Economic Development
Prerequisites: ECON 501, 503 and 525; or equivalent.
Why are some countries poor and others rich? What can account for cross-country differences in fertility and mortality rates? In gender gaps, civil war, and school attainment? Why did the industrial revolution start in Europe? Why did Europe colonize the rest of the world, rather than the other way around? Why are some former colonies (e.g., U.S., Canada) so much richer than others (e.g., India and Zimbabwe)? This course presents research which addresses these issues. While emphasis in on theoretical research where overlapping-generations models are used to generate multiple steady-state equilibria, empirical work is also examined.
