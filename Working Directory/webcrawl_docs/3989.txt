Robotics
The Robotics Division specializes in the design, manufacturing and testing of planetary rovers for soil sampling and soil analysis.
About the Robotics Division
Space Concordia’s Robotics Division is the society’s third competition-based end-to-end project. It was formed as a result of an engineering final capstone project on 2012. The team is composed of 4 main subdivisions: Software, Power, Electrical, and Mechanical. In addition to competing in the University Rover Challenge, the Robotics Division participates in the IEEE RoboWars competition with a smaller robot.
Competition Overview
Space Concordia’s Robotics Division plans to compete annually in the University Rover Challenge (URC), in southern Utah, US. The URC challenges student teams to design and build the next generation of Mars rovers that will one day work alongside astronauts exploring the Red Planet. The competition is organized by The Mars Society, an international non-profit humans to Mars organization.
