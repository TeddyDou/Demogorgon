Magie d'Andalousie avec Benjamin Bouzaglo et Leila Gouchi
December 3, 2017, 8 p.m. – 10:30 p.m.
Magie d'Andalousie avec Benjamin Bouzaglo et Leila Gouchi
Fondé par la compositrice et chef d’orchestre Katia Makdissi-Warren, qui agit comme directrice artistique, l’Orchestre Sépharade Andalou de Montréal est constitué de 14 musiciens originaires du Canada et du Moyen-Orient.
Ce nouvel ensemble maitrise un large éventail de styles musicaux et nous offre des créations originales et des fusions musicales inédites.
Lors de cette soirée, l’envoutante Leila Gouchi et l’incontournable Benjamin Bouzaglo interpréteront en duo ou en solo des chants andalous tirés du répertoire sépharade.
Deux voix, une même passion au service 
de la préservation et de la transmission 
de notre patrimoine musical
