Governor General Award-Winning Author Peter Behrens, will hold a Master Class in screenwriting for film and theatre students

The New York Times called his second novel, The O'Briens, "a major achievement" and Megan O'Grady, writing in Vogue, calls Carry Me, his latest novel, “another meditation on history and destiny . . . that make[s] the past feel stunningly close at hand.” Carry Me won The Vine Award for Canadian Jewish Literature.

This is a novel that could be, should be, read in a hundred years." —The Jury ) The novels are being developed as features and as series.

Le jumelage interculturel: documentation des pratiques et évaluation des impacts
La présentation portera sur la réalisation d’une recherche-action sur le jumelage interculturel, un programme de rapprochement interculturel mettant en lien un membre de la société d’accueil (jumeau d’accueil) et un nouvel arrivant (jumeau arrivant). Dans le cadre de la recherche, dix intervenants de jumelage, neuf jumeaux d’accueil et neuf jumeaux arrivants de dix organismes québécois ont été interviewés afin de documenter les pratiques et de mesurer les impacts du jumelage. Déborah Grausem (Responsable du jumelage interculturel et Soutien à la formation et à l’accès aux ressources, Table de concertation au service des personnes réfugiées et immigrantes) présentera les résultats de recherche (complétée en mars dernier) et les difficultés d’appliquer les résultats sur le terrain (toujours en cours). Présentation en français. Discussion en français et en anglais. Dégustation de thé et collation gratuits. Les ateliers de recherche en immigration du CEPI ont pour objectif de réunir les étudiants, les chercheurs et les intervenants de tous les domaines, affiliations et niveaux d'études afin de faire avancer nos projets de recherche en cours portant sur l'immigration. Les participants auront l'opportunité de participer à des discussions enrichissantes, de recevoir des commentaires constructives et de réseauter tout en dégustant du thé de qualité !
