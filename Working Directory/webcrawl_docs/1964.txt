Philosophy (MA)
Master of Arts (MA)
Offered by:
Department of Philosophy , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why pursue a Master's in Philosophy?
The central focus of philosophy is developing rigorous conceptual frameworks and methods of conceptual analysis adequate to addressing fundamental questions about reality and human life, including questions about the direction we’re headed in as humans.  By cultivating your philosophical ability at the MA level you’ll be in a position to wrestle with some of our most significant concerns: the basis of ethical action, human rights, global justice or our relationship with the environment.
At Concordia, we specialize in and encompass both Anglo-American and Continental-European approaches, as well as the history of philosophy.
Our MA students are looking at topics such as: Global justice, Kant’s metaphysics, Merleau-Ponty and traumatic memory, as well as Levinas’s ethics.
We offer a personalized learning environment , supported by a community of committed professors.
Our students are well-placed to continue in the field by pursuing doctoral studies and many are now working at universities around the world .  Whatever your path, clarity of thought and careful reasoning, along with familiarity with the history of ideas, will prove invaluable assets.
Program options & degree requirements
You may choose one of two options.
Option A: MA with research paper
Option B: MA with thesis
We encourage students who plan to continue their studies at the doctoral level to write a research paper (option A). You’ll finish with a strong writing sample to submit with your application to a PhD program, and you may also submit the paper for graduate and professional conferences or journals.
You may choose to take the equivalent of six credits at other Quebec universities, including Université de Montréal, McGill University, or the Université du Québec à Montréal, with permission from the Graduate Program Director. 
See full degree requirements in the graduate calendar .
Admission requirements
