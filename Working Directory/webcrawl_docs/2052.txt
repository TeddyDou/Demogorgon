Dr. Giuliana Cucinelli is an Assistant Professor in the Educational Technology Program in the Department of Education at Concordia University, and the co-director of the Community and Differential Motilities cluster for Concordia University's Institute for Digital Arts, Culture and Technology. Cucinelli's research-creation program focuses on the social, cultural and educational impacts of technology.
Currently she is a principal investigator on
a Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) Insight Development Grant and
a Fonds de recherche du Québec – Société et culture (FRQSC), Établissement de nouveaux professeurs grant which examines digital device practices and policy in K-12 schools in Quebec and Ontario. She is also a PI on a Concordia funded research-creation project Virtual Reality and Empathy Education: Understanding Cultural, Gender and Ethnic Difference in the Workplace.
Furthermore, she is a co-applicant on  ACT: Ageing, Communication, Technologies , a multi-methodological research project that brings together  researchers and institutional and community partners  to address the transformation of the experiences of ageing with the proliferation of new forms of mediated communications in networked societies. The project is funded by a SSHRC Partnership Grant, with Dr. Kim Sawchuk as Director and Principal Investigator.
Before joining Concordia, Cucinelli was a FRQSC Postdoctoral Research Associate for the  Comparative Media Studies Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Cambridge), with research affiliations to their  Open Documentary Lab , the  Center for Civic Media , and the  Youth and Media Project  in the  Berkman Center for Internet and Society  at Harvard University, and a Postdoctoral Research Affiliate for the Mobilities Lab in the Department of Communication Studies at Concordia University.
