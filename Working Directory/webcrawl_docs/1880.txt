FAS 2025: Strategic Directions for Arts and Science
THE MIND THE GAP PROJECT
This initiative springboards from the Mapping Project . With Mind the Gap, we are implementing activities to address student-preparedness prior to, during and post-university studies. 
Activities include:
the development and testing of learning boot-camps to ensure competencies in language, writing, numeracy, and sciences
partnering with CEGEPs to better prepare for student integration and readiness for university life
enhancing services and academic supports for Indigenous students
exploring the possibility of offering programs for new immigrants to Quebec
organizing grant writing workshops for faculty and students
