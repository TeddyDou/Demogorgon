Research
Drug and Alcohol Abuse, Relapse, Learning, Neuroscience
Overview: Fundamental learning processes like Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning play a central role in the use, misuse and abuse of psychoactive substances like alcohol. In my laboratory, we use preclinical models in rats to study psychological processes and neurobiological systems that regulate drug-seeking behaviours and relapse. Neuroscientific techniques include neuropharmacology, in-vivo optogenetics, chemogenetics, in-vitro electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry. We are currently pursing three exciting research directions that probe the central hypothesis that environmental stimuli that become associated with alcohol help to maintain alcohol use and trigger relapse. Project 1 seeks to identify neural processes that are needed for the expression of alcohol-seeking behaviours triggered by Pavlovian alcohol cues. Project 2 investigates brain mechanisms that mediate the inhibition or extinction of responding to Pavlovian cues that occurs when a cue is no longer followed by an expected event. Project 3 examines the effect of nicotine, the main active ingredient in tobacco, on alcohol-seeking behaviours triggered by Pavlovian alcohol cues. Translational studies are also underway to test the utility of compounds that act on the cholinergic system in the brain in preventing relapse to alcohol seeking behaviour. Through this research, we hope to expand our understanding of how drug abuse develops and inform new treatments for dependence and addiction.
Funding: My research is funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), the Natural Sciences Engineering and Research Council of Canada (NSERC), Fonds de la recherche du Québec – Santé (FRQ-S), the Canadian Foundation for Innovation (CFI), and Concordia University.

Biography
Dr. Chaudhri earned her B.A. in Biological Foundations of Behavior with a concentration in Neuroscience at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, PA, USA. She completed her Ph. D. in Neuroscience at the University of Pittsburgh in 2005. Dr. Chaudhri did her post-doctoral training in Neurobiology at the Ernest Gallo Clinic and Research Center at the University of California in San Francisco. She joined the CSBN and the Department of Psychology at Concordia University in January 2010 as an Assistant Professor and was promoted to Associate Professor with tenure in June 2014.
Fun fact
I get a kick out of growing (veggies), hunting (mushrooms) and catching (fish) my own food.
