What is academic integrity?
Academic integrity means that every student must be honest and accurate in their work. This means that there are rules and regulations to follow when presenting your work as your own.
...all students are expected to be honest in all of their academic endeavours and relationships with the University.
(Article 1, Academic Code of Conduct)
Resources
Concordia University has several resources available to help students better understand and uphold academic integrity :
a presentation of the Academic Code of Conduct ;
an explanation of plagiarism and offences under the Academic Code of Conduct ;
and an outline of the consequences if you violate academic integrity.
