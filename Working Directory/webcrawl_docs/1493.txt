Board and Senate Administration

Danielle Tessier
Danielle Tessier graduated from Université du Québec à Montréal in 1983 with a Bachelor's Degree in Law. She was also a part-time attendee of Concordia University between 1985 and 1988, during which time she completed 21 credits in the Graduate Diploma in Writing/Translation.
After graduating, Ms. Tessier worked as an assistant in a Montreal law firm before joining The Laurentian Group Corporation in 1987 as a Legal Affairs Assistant. In the Fall of 1993, the shares of The Laurentian Group Corporation were acquired by Desjardins-Laurentian Financial Corporation, the holding company of the corporate sector of the Mouvement Desjardins, and she continued her employment as Corporate Secretary.
Ms. Tessier was appointed as Director, Board and Senate Administration at Concordia in September 2000. As such, she is the Secretary of the Board of Governors and several of its standing committees as well as Secretary of Senate and its Steering Committee.
