Child Studies (MA)
Master of Arts (MA)
Offered by:
Department of Education , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why pursue a Master's in Child Studies?
Education researchers and professionals know that in order to work with children, they must be conscious of the biological, psychological, and emotional changes that occur during childhood. They also need to understand the critical role that families, peers, teachers, communities, and culture play in development. 
The MA in Child Studies provides a stimulating environment where you will investigate many facets of children’s lives, such as cognition, social functioning, language and literacy, moral development, and play.  Our distinguished faculty members offer individualized mentorship and support, enabling you to link theory to practice as you develop and carry out an internship project or thesis research.
Gain access to our Observation Nursery where you can use observational techniques, photographs, video-and-audio-recordings, and authentic work samples to document children's learning processes and privileged access to computer workstations.
As part of a diverse cohort of students, you will study alongside emerging scholars and working professionals seeking an advanced degree. The City of Montreal also provides unique opportunities to work with children and families, including Quebec’s universal childcare system, preschool programs, diverse schools (including French immersion and alternative schools), afterschool programs, two children's hospitals, and community services.
Program Details
Program options and degree requirements
Students may choose to apply to one of two options in their pursuit of this degree:
Option A (Thesis Option): Students will pursue a particular area of interest, conduct their own research, and report the research in a thesis.
Option B (Internship Option): Students will complete 200 hours of fieldwork in a setting serving children or youth, and will write a comprehensive internship report based on this experience.
In both options, students are supervised by a faculty member with mutual interests.  Thesis and internship students also take many of the same courses, allowing for rich exchanges amongst students with various professional, research, and personal experiences.
Consult the graduate calendar  for complete degree requirements.
Admission requirements
Admission Requirements. Applicants will be selected on the basis of past academic records, letters of recommendation, field experience, and the relevance of their proposed research to the areas of specialization of program faculty. To be accepted into the program, a student is required to have an undergraduate degree with a minimum of a B average and a significant concentration in child studies, education, or related discipline. In addition, at least one year of professional experience in the field of child care, education, or related areas is desirable. Bilingualism is an asset, but not a requirement. The equivalence of foreign degrees is assessed by the School of Graduate Studies, and is determined by consideration of the total length of program study (primary through university) as well as the quality and content of post-secondary study and its relevance to this program.
Proficiency in English. Applicants whose primary language is not English must demonstrate that their knowledge of English is sufficient to pursue graduate studies in their chosen field. Please refer to the  Graduate Admission page  for further information on the Language Proficiency requirements and exemptions.

Faculty research interests
Our faculty members are a diverse group of educators committed to excellence in teaching, research, and community service. They are well known for their strong research profiles that inform their teaching and afford graduate students the opportunity to work on cutting edge research.
Faculty research interests include:
children's peer and sibling relationships
children's play
historical and international perspectives on childcare
curriculum and instruction
inclusive practices and education
popular culture of children and youth
teaching, teacher education, and teacher identity
gender issues
family
moral development
learning and cognition in relation to mathematics
language development and literacy
Internship
Students who select the Internship Option work in conjunction with a faculty member to determine a placement site and identify an issue to be explored at the site. Past students have worked in settings such as community agencies, childcare centres, schools, and hospitals.
Internships typically take place during the program’s second year. Students first propose an issue to explore (for example, child development, family relationships, teaching quality, curriculum development, service delivery), then complete the internship and write a comprehensive report of the internship experience.
Student Initiatives
The Graduate Child Studies Association represents all students in our program and is responsible for organizing a number of social events throughout the academic year.
The Graduate Symposium in the Department of Education (GSDE) is an annual event that invites students across Canada to present their research. The GSDE is a student-run conference and offers you the opportunity to learn more about grant applications and event planning.
Graduate students are also encouraged to present their research findings at various regional, national, and international conferences. Past students have presented papers at the Society for the Scientific Study of Reading, the Congress of the Humanities and Social Sciences, the Canadian Education Researchers’ Association, the American Educational Research Association, the Society for Research in Child Development, and the International Association for the Study of Child Language.
