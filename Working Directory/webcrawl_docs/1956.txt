Human Systems Intervention (MA)
Master of Arts (MA)
Offered by:
Department of Applied Human Sciences , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why pursue a Master's in Human Systems Intervention?
Gain the confidence and capacity to contract with clients, evaluate group dynamics and carry out change processes. Explore the theories behind various change modalities that will enable you to facilitate and engage with stakeholders as you design an intervention.
The MA in Human Systems Intervention provides a stimulating academic environment where you will learn how to plan and implement whole system change processes. Working in close collaboration with students in your cohort, you will gain a deep understanding of how individuals, teams and systems function, learn, and change, applying that knowledge to interventions for third-party organizations.
Benefit from a concentrated program structure that allows you to continue working part-time while you study. Our course schedule is designed so students can take the skills they learn in class and immediately put them into use in their workplace. The schedule also permits students to live in other cities and commute to Montreal to attend class and on-campus residencies.
In addition to the individualized support distinguished faculty members provide during your classes and master’s project, you will also work with a field supervisor who has a great deal of experience working in the context you are interested in. Field supervisors are graduates from our program who now occupy prominent positions in a number of highly successful institutions, including Deloitte, Manulife Financial Corporation, Bombardier Inc., the McGill University Health Centre, and the House of Commons of Canada.
Program details
Degree requirements
Requirements for the Degree
Credits. A fully-qualified candidate is required to complete a minimum of 45 credits. 42 credits will be in required coursework, including 15 credits of project work. The remaining 3 credits are to be completed within or outside the department. Courses that are taken to complete entrance requirements to the program may not be counted toward the program’s 45 credits. In exceptional cases, students who produce evidence of successful performance (B grade or better) in compatible coursework at other institutions may be permitted transfer credit. A maximum of 9 credits in transfer courses will be permitted.
Coursework. The program is divided into two sections of coursework, with Year I establishing the prerequisites for Year II. In addition, students will have a minimum of 3 credits of elective coursework to complete their degree requirements.
Year I provides students with fundamental understanding and frames of reference regarding learning and change processes of persons and groups, steps in the intervention process, ethical principles, and research methods. These fundamental understandings are then deepened through application in practice-based courses of Year II. The Master’s Project is intended to promote an integration of concepts and practical experience.
