About
LibQUAL+ is a survey used by  libraries that measures the quality of library services. It is completed by students and  faculty members at several universities across Canada and coordinated by the  Canadian Association of Research Libraries (CARL) . The LibQUAL+  survey was originally developed by scholars at Texas A&M University in  collaboration with the Association of Research Libraries (ARL) , and over 1000 libraries  from various countries have participated in this survey since 2000.
The goals of LibQUAL+ are to:
Foster a culture of       excellence in providing library service
Help libraries better       understand user perceptions of library service quality
Collect and interpret       library user feedback systematically over time
Provide libraries with       comparable assessment information from peer institutions
Identify best practices in       library service
Enhance library staff       members' analytical skills for interpreting and acting on data
Further information can also be found at libqual.org .
