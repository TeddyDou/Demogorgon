LA FRANCOPHONIE PROJECT
The Francophonie Project raises the profile of FAS in the francophone milieu – in Montreal, Quebec and abroad – through ambitious recruitment initiatives and campus activities en français.
Join us as we build bridges to the Francophonie by:
enhancing francophone CEGEP outreach,  through recruitment and partnerships between Concordia and CEGEP professors
developing an FAS international strategy
initiating an FAS version of the “Faire le grand saut” program of the John Molson School of Business
