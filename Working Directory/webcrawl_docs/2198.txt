Biography
Dr. Gouin, a clinical psychologist, holds a Canada Research Chair in Chronic Stress and Health and leads the Stress, Interpersonal Relationships, and Health Laboratory.
Research interests
Our research program investigates the impact of chronic stress on health and well-being. Specifically, we examine risk and resiliency psychosocial processes (emotion regulation, interpersonal relationship quality & sleep quality) impacting the negative psychological and physiological consequences of cumulative or chronic exposure to social and environmental stressors over the life course. In this context, we are also interested in identifying neurophysiological indicators of sensitivity to the social environment and vulnerability to stress, with a particular emphasis on oxytocin and heart rate variability. 
Current funded studies examine:
-The impact of chronic stress and interpersonal relationships on depression and systemic inflammation among parents of adolescents and adults with neurodevelopmental disorders during the transition to adulthood. Funded by CIHR.
-The role of heart rate variability in the impact of chronic parenting stress on marital quality and dyadic coping processes among parents of young children. Funded by SSHRC.
-The impact of cognitive-behavioural treatment for insomnia on stress-related insomnia, emotion regulation, and inflammation among individuals with primary insomnia and insomnia with comorbid depression. Funded by CIHR.
*We are currently looking for a graduate student or a post-doctoral fellow interested in pursuing research on stress-induced insomnia.
