A plastic ocean: We need a wave of change
June 8, 2017, 6 p.m. – 10 p.m.
Plastic Oceans Montreal invites you to come celebrate World Oceans Day on June 8, 2017 with the Plastic Oceans Foundation Canada as we host the first public Quebec screening of its new documentary,  A Plastic Ocean .
This acclaimed feature length documentary was made by the Plastic Oceans Foundation - a global network of independent not-for-profit and charitable organisations - united in their aims to change the way we deal with plastic waste by challenging society's perception that this indestructible substance can be treated as 'disposable'. They aim to change the world's attitude towards plastic within one generation.
Filmed in 20 locations around the world, 'A Plastic Ocean' gives a global perspective on the issue of plastic waste in our oceans and examines the extent of the problem. Most importantly it shows us the ways that we can turn it around, not just through knowledge and behavioural changes but with amazing new technology. It has the potential to benefit our health and that of our children, our environment and our seas.
After the film, join us for a panel discussion, where local experts will talk about plastic pollution in a Montreal context and offer some ideas and advice that we can use to make immediate changes in our city. We are very excited to announce that   Dr. Peter Stoett  of Concordia University’s Loyola Sustainability Research Centre , is among our panelists. Other panelists include Daniel Green , Deputy Leader of the Green Party of Canada, and Chantal Rouleau , Mayor of Rivière-des-Prairies–Pointe-aux-Trembles; member of Montreal's Executive Committee with responsibility for water and water infrastructures
Don’t forget to show up early, as we will be hosting a Plastic Free Fair starting at 6 pm where you can meet some of our partners at their booths and learn about how they can help you reduce your plastic footprint!
This event is free to attend and open to the public. Tickets are available on Eventbrite , where you can also purchase raffle tickets to win great prizes including:
Gift certificate to  Eileen's Oceanwise Seafood Oyster Bar
Passes to the  Biodome
T-shirt from  5 Gyres
Stainless steel cup from  Klean Kanteen

...and much, much more!

A word from the Oganizer, Plastic Oceans Foundation Canada - Quebec Chapter:
Plastic Oceans Foundation Canada is part of a global network of independent not-for-profit and charitable organizations, united in their aims to change the way we deal with plastic waste by challenging society’s perception that this indestructible substance can be treated as "disposable" and change the world's attitude to plastic within one generation.
With the longest coastline in the world but several provinces without any ocean borders, we serve all aquatic environments around and within Canada and all the creatures touched by them by working to solve a global problem with local actions.
