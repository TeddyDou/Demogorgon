Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP)
Information Session
December 5, 2017, 10 a.m. – 11:30 a.m.
Are you an International Student who will be graduating soon? Did you know that you are allowed to work in Canada after you graduate from a participating Canadian Post-Secondary Institution?
This session is intended to clarify the policies outlining the Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP) program as well as assist with the application process. Immigration Canada's policy of post-graduation employment was developed to benefit international students in a meaningful way, by enabling them to acquire Canadian work experience.
Please register in advance for the workshop that suits your schedule
PLEASE NOTE THAT THE ISO HAS MOVED TO THE GM BUILDING.
Sign-up for only one session.
