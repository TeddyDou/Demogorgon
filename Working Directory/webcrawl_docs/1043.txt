What is engineering?
Engineers are the builders of modern society. Engineering education is built on a foundation of mathematics and the scientific knowledge appropriate to the particular engineering discipline. Engineering students learn how to apply this knowledge in the analysis and design of products, systems and processes. The background of engineering ensures creative and optimal solutions, while maintaining a rigorous and disciplined approach. Engineers must work to achieve measurable objectives in factors such as efficiency, reliability, mobility, adaptability, economic viability and security. The engineering profession expects of its members competence, understanding of sustainable development and sensitivity to the effect of technology on society.
Concordia University offers programs in Building, Civil, Computer, Electrical, Industrial and Software Engineering. Within each of these programs, students also have an opportunity to specialize in areas from aerospace to environment, to telecommunications, to name only a few.
What is computer science?
Computer Science is the study and design of computer systems. The theoretical and mathematical foundations of computation provide Computer Scientists with an understanding of software and hardware structures, and gives them the skill to use their knowledge in effective and creative design. It also enables them to easily adapt to the new developments in this rapidly changing field.
At Concordia University our program allows students to specialize or generalize with options in Software Systems, Computer Systems, Information Systems or Computer Applications. We also have a unique program with the Faculty of Fine Arts that allows students to have a joint major in Digital Image and Sound.
