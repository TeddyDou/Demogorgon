Philosophy (BA)
Bachelor of Arts (BA)
Offered by:
Department of Philosophy , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why study Philosophy?
Philosophers reflect on some of the world’s most serious problems: the basis of ethical action, human rights, global justice or our relationship with the environment. Or they ask questions about what the mind, knowledge, science, identity, gender and sexuality really are. Whatever the issue, philosophers learn how to analyze ideas and arguments, and reason well. They also make discoveries about the history of ideas and how this shapes the way we think about contemporary life.
Studying philosophy will open your eyes to these deep ideas and questions, teach you to analyze them with philosophical insight and rigour, to read, write and reason well, and build skills for speech and debate. As you reflect on the assumptions that inform our social, political, and scientific practices, you will think about, and relate to, the political, social and natural world in an entirely new way.
An undergraduate degree in philosophy is the stepping stone to graduate studies or a wide variety of careers that require critical thinking, careful writing, or superior communication skills.
