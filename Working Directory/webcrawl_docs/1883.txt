INTERNATIONAL GRADUATE SUMMER SCHOOLS
Cultivating innovative and interdisciplinary approaches to research, teaching and learning
 
  
This summer, the Faculty of Arts and Science hosted four intensive, interdisciplinary  summer schools and two field schools that brought together Masters and PhD students from various  disciplines, and from around the world.
