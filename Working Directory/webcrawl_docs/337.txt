Karen Taillon
Office Manager
As a graduate of Concordia University, I was pleased to return in 1994 as the Association’s Office Manager. I am very happy to be here at CUPFA as part of the CUPFA family. I am responsible for the front-line services offered to all members who call and to assist part-time faculty maneuver through the sometimes murky waters of Concordia. If I don’t have the answer to your question, I can certainly steer you in the right direction.

I have been working as Assistant Grievance Officer for CUPFA since 2007, when the position was established. In this regard, I prepare and research issues concerning grievances and the CUPFA Collective Agreement. Working in concert with our Vice President, Collective Agreement and Grievances, I attend when required Grievance Hearings. In addition, I have served numerous terms as the PT Hiring rep for the Departments of Music and Communication Studies from 2002 to the present, as well as on the Music Curriculum Committee. As a member of the CUPFA Advisory Council I sit on the Fine Arts Environmental Health and Safety Committee .

Legal Intern
Since January 2015, CUPFA has participated in training several law school graduates on their way to becoming lawyers.  They have passed the Bar exam and are completing their final six month internship under the supervision of Me Patrice Blais, VP Collective Agreement and Grievances.  You might remember Max Silverman, Pierre-Luc Bouchard, Catherine LeGuerrier or JoséEve McCarthy from a CUPFA event?
Come by the CUPFA office and meet the current legal intern.  They are here to answer your questions related to the Collective Agreement, or to a situation concerning your employment as a part-time professor at Concordia.  They help out with legal research, negotiations, and representation related to the grievance clinic.
