My research interests are social and political philosophy  (in particular, democratic theory and marxism) as well as 19th and 20th Century  European philosophy (especially German critical theory and deconstruction). My primary research project at this time (for which I have been awarded federal Canadian funding, SSHRC) seeks to show the relevance of phenomenology and deconstruction to  intergenerational justice, in particular  the vexed question of obligations to distant future people. In this context, I  explore a notion of indirect reciprocity - roughly, the present owes to the  future because of gifts from the past - that promises to do justice to the  intergenerational connections of social life. I also argue that the idea of taking turns with future people and with the earth is promising both ontologically and normatively. A second book project develops a concept of deconstructive normativity in relation to metaethics, biopolitics, and environmental philosophy. I am also co-editing (with Phil Lynes and David Wood) a book called Eco-Deconstruction: Derrida and Environmental Philosophy.
