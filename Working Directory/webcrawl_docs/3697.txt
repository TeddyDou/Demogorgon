Can I retake a class that I failed or simply want to get a better grade on? Will it completely replace my grade? When will the new CGPA appear with my grade?
As outlined in the Concordia website:
A student may repeat a failed course only once. Nevertheless, a student who fails a required course twice may appeal to the appropriate Student Request Committee for permission to take the course a third time. If permission is not granted, the student may not be allowed to continue in the University towards that program and/or degree.
A student who has received a passing grade for a course may repeat the course for personal reasons (e.g. to meet an external requirement) only once. A student may appeal to the appropriate Student Request Committee for permission to take the course a third time. The student record and official transcript will include all grades, but grades with the “REPT” notation will carry no credit value.
A student who wants or needs to repeat a course that is prerequisite to other courses must do so before taking any following course in the sequence.
The grade corresponding to the latest attempt of the course will be used for calculating the cumulative grade point average and the final graduation grade point average.
In the case of courses taken more than once in the same assessment period, only the grade corresponding to the latest attempt of the course will be used in the calculation of the assessment grade point average.
A grade obtained as the result of a penalty for academic misconduct will remain in the calculation of the AGPA, the CGPA, and the FGGPA whether or not the course has been repeated.
Can I view my grades on my phone without logging into the MyConcordia Portal?
Concordia’s personalized messaging service, available via the portal, will send texts to your mobile phone or email account alerting you of class cancellations, and will inform you when there’s an emergency situation on campus.

What can I do when I have two or three exams in a row?
You must report an exam conflict in order to be granted an alternate exam. To report a conflict, go to your personal exam schedule in the MyConcordia portal before the deadline.
In many cases you will be able to select the exam to be written as an alternate, but sometimes you will have no choice. In general, alternates are scheduled for the first Sunday that follows the original exam date.
If you have two exams at the same date and time:
   Report the conflict
   Decide which exam you will write on the originally scheduled day and which one you will write on the alternate day
   If you don’t decide before the established deadline, the Examinations Office will choose for you.
If you have three exams in a row:
   Decide if you want to write them all at the date and time scheduled, or choose one to write an alternate
   Report your conflict and choice by the deadline
    •    If you don’t choose an alternate exam before the established deadline, the Examinations Office will not choose for you; you will have to write the exam at the originally schedule date and time.
What happens if I missed the deadline to report an exam conflict?
If you miss the deadline to report a conflict, you must call the Examinations Office at 514-848-2424, ext. 2608, 2609 or 2676 to report it.
What constitutes an exam conflict?
The university uses the following criteria to define conflicts:
    1    Two or more exams scheduled at the same day and time
    2    Three exams scheduled in consecutive time blocks, for example:  
    ◦    9:00 am, 2:00 pm, 7:00 pm
    ◦    2:00 pm, 7:00 pm, 9:00 am
    ◦    7:00 pm, 9:00 am, 2:00 pm
    3    An exam scheduled at the same time as a religious observance.
    4    An exam scheduled at a time when an employer will deny time off.
For legitimate conflicts, you may write an alternate exam.

   Two exams on the same day
   Three exams in 24 or 48 hours

https://www.concordia.ca/content/dam/jmsb/docs/programs/undergraduate/2012-10-10_jmsb_student_request_final.pdf
Will I receive a refund when I drop out of the Co-op program?
Students who withdraw from the co-op program on or before the published DNE withdrawal deadline will receive a refund or financial credit on their student account for the co-op fee if it has already been paid.
Students who withdraw from the co-op program after the published DNE withdrawal deadline will not receive a refund or financial credit for the co-op fee.
Will I receive a refund when I drop a course?
Yes, and no.
There are 2 different kinds of withdrawal/drop deadlines. One will generate a refund or a financial credit on the student’s account; the other will not.
DNE (Did not enter) withdrawal deadline = full refund or financial credit on account
If you drop a course before the DNE deadline, you will not be charged any fees and you can obtain a refund for any courses for which you had already paid.
DISC (Discontinued) withdrawal deadline = no refund or financial credit on account
If you drop a course after the DNE deadline and before the DISC deadline, you will see a DISC grade notation on your student record. You will be held financially responsible and must pay for all the fees for the discontinued course, even if you never attended a single class. After all, by registering for and then not dropping the course, you have reserved a seat in the classroom that cannot be filled by another student.
