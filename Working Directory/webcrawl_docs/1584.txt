Labour agreements and status of collective bargaining
The Labour agreements and Collective bargaining section contains all the labour agreements in effect at Concordia, the latest information about our collective bargaining activity and collective bargaining in general.  For more information please read the FAQ.
Concordia values each faculty and staff member and respects their rights to choose to be represented by a union or staff association. We strive to develop and maintain positive, respectful and constructive relationships with all employee groups, during negotiations and throughout the life of negotiated agreements. We negotiate at the bargaining table, with the bargaining teams selected by the respective employee groups for this purpose.
We will communicate with faculty, staff, students, parents and stakeholders about the status of collective bargaining in a manner that does not impede or interfere with the collective bargaining process.
