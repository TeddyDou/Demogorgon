Peer tutoring
We now offer a peer tutoring service! Students seeking a tutor can request access to our tutor bank, and from there contact a listed tutor of their choice.
Tutors are linguistics students:
who have completed at least 13 LING credits.
who have received a grade of A+ or A in the courses they offer their services for.
for whom we have received a note of recommendation from a Concordia linguistics faculty member.
The hourly rate is set at 20$, for both group and individual sessions.
