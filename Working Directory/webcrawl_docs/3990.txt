Sponsors
We would like to thank all of our sponsors for their contributions. We would also like to reassure our sponsors that they are part of something greater than just student competitions. We are working very hard to go beyond your average student society to prove to our sponsors and to the public that we are capable of accomplishing much more when given the resources to do so. Your contributions have most certainly not been put to waste and we will work hard to make sure to secure an even brighter future for Space Concordia.
