Club Description: 
The Concordia Games Club is a group of people that get together to play board games, card games, RPGs, and anything our heart desires. We hold an open board gaming evening every Wednesday at 6:30pm in room SC-03-11 at Loyola. So come hang out, relax, and take a break from your scholarly worries. We are always taking suggestions for new games, and our collection grows every year. Come check out our shelves full of new and vintage games that have been preserved since the Game Club's creation in the late 60's. Everyone is welcome!
