Emergency notifications
Here's how you can find out about emergency situations on or near Concordia.
Computer pop-up alerts
As part of the University's emergency communication strategy, it is currently deploying computer pop-up alert system on university owned computers.  
Students and employees are encouraged to download the Alertus application software that would allow them to receive these pop-up alerts on their computers.  The alerts appear as a full screen message like the image below.  Once the user has read the message, and taken the appropriate action, they can simply click on the green acknowledge button to clear the message.
To download and set up the secure Alertus application:
Go to MyConcordia portal 
Select Software and Applications: 
Select Alertus Emerg. Notifications and then the appropriate operating system and then the appropriate client. 
If you spend all your time on a particular campus, select the appropriate campus client.  
If you are frequently moving from one campus, to another, select the mobile client which will provide pop-up alerts for both campuses.
Note:  the alertus Mobile client is meant for download and installation on laptop computers.  The client does not function on mobile devices. Pop-up alert messages will only function when the laptop computer is connected to the university network or wifi network.
For more information on Alertus, e-mail us at  Emergency.Management@concordia.ca
 
Emergency information line (514-848-8800)
514-848-8800 or 8800 is the number for the emergency information line. 
Recorded information concerning a significant emergency that has affected university operations or caused a building(s) to be closed will be posted and regularly updated on the emergency information line.
Building public address systems (PA)
Most large buildings at Concordia have a public address system (P.A.) as part of a building's fire alarm.  The building P.A. system will be used to communicate information concerning an emergency situation to building occupants.  If the fire alarm is hear, this is a signal to evacuate immediately, do not wait for the P.A. message to confirm an evacuation.
