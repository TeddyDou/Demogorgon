Our acclaimed faculty members will expose you to four major subfields, encompassing applied linguistics, child studies, educational studies and educational technology, that provide a versatile foundation for you to consider research across disciplines and orientations.
Take advantage of resources that are for the exclusive use of graduate students at our state-of-the-art facilities . Benefit from your own research space, as well as privileged access to computer workstations and a media development lab.
With financial support from the department and university, our students have been able to present their research at international conferences in Amsterdam, Austria, Brazil, Cyprus, Denmark, England, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Singapore, Spain and Uruguay. Along with a growing number of joint publications between students and faculty, you will be joining a cohort that is immediately contributing to cutting edge educational research and the civic life of the department.
Program Details
Degree requirements
Credits. A fully-qualified candidate is required to complete a minimum of 90 credits.
Residence. The minimum period of residence is two years (6 terms) of full-time study beyond the master’s degree, or the equivalent in part-time study. A minimum of one year of full-time study is highly recommended.
Orientation. Each candidate is assigned an interim research supervisor and a supervisory committee. This interim supervisory committee consists of three members of the faculty, including a research supervisor. This supervisory committee advises the student on courses to take, including prerequisite courses where necessary (to be determined no later than the first two weeks of the student’s first term), and arranges for the comprehensive examination. At this time the membership of the student’s interim committee is replaced by a dissertation committee of the student's choice.
Courses. Each candidate is required to complete the following:
EDUC 806 – Quantitative Methods (3 credits)
EDUC 807 – Qualitative Methods (3 credits)
EDUC 808 – Reporting Research (3 credits)
EDUC 809 – Advanced Issues in Education (3 credits)
9 credits of elective courses
EDUC 890 – Comprehensive Examination (12 credits)
Each candidate must successfully complete EDUC 890 before being admitted to candidacy for the degree. The comprehensive consists of a written and oral examination that tests the candidate on both general and area specific research. After successfully completing the comprehensive examination, the student is admitted to candidacy for the degree.
EDUC 891 – Doctoral Proposal (9 credits)
Note: the proposal is accepted only after the student is admitted to candidacy.
EDUC 895 – Doctoral Dissertation (48 credits).
A doctoral thesis is expected to make an original contribution to knowledge, and be presented in acceptable literary form.
Admission requirements
Admission Requirements. The normal requirement for admission is a Master of Arts degree in Education, Applied Linguistics, Child Studies, Educational Studies, or Educational Technology, with high standing, from an accredited university. Applicants with a Master’s degree in a related field or discipline, such as psychology, sociology, anthropology, adult education, and human resource development, are considered. Applicants from other disciplines might be offered conditional admission which may include fulfilling prerequisite courses.
 
Application process
Prior to applying, please email us to request the PhD Education program booklet.
Your completed application will include:
Application form and Fee
Curriculum Vitae (CV)
Three  Letters of Reference  and  Academic Assessment forms
Statement of purpose outlining the primary area or field of concentration and research goals
Scholarly writing sample, such as a chapter from an MA thesis or a research paper
Transcripts  for all post-secondary institutions attended
Proof of Canadian citizenship  (if applicable)

Note: Applicants to the PhD in Education do not choose a supervisor as part of the application process.  Instead, we assign an interim supervisor and committee to accepted students, who guide the student through their comprehensive exams. At that point—with full knowledge of our faculty—students choose a dissertation committee and supervisor.
Please apply  online . Read the  how-to guide  for application procedures.
