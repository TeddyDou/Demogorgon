Peter Gossage's Explore Concordia page
Peter Gossage holds graduate degrees in Quebec history from McGill University and the Université du Québec à Montréal. He arrived at Concordia in 2009 from a faculty position at the Université de Sherbrooke, which he had held since 1993. A scholar of nineteenth- and twentieth-century Quebec, his main research interests are in family life, gender, and historical demography. Peter’s first book, Families in Transition: Industry and Population in Nineteenth-Century Saint-Hyacinthe, was published by McGill-Queen’s University Press in 1999. He is co-author of two further books: La fécondité des Québécoises, 1870-1970 : d'une exception à l'autre, with Danielle Gauvreau and Diane Gervais (Boréal, 2007); and most recently An Illustrated History of Quebec: Tradition and Modernity, with J.I. Little (Oxford University Press, 2012).  An active member of the Centre interuniversitaire d’études québécoises ( www.cieq.ca ), Peter has served as co-editor of the Canadian Historical Review (2000-2002) and held visiting fellowships at the University of Victoria (1999-2000) and at the University of California, Berkeley (2007-2008).  He is also co-director, with John Lutz and Ruth Sandwell, of the prize-winning educational website Great Unsolved Mysteries in Canadian History ( www.canadianmysteries.ca ).
