Exhibition
November 4 – December 2, 2017
Opening 
Saturday, November 4, 3 – 5 p.m.
The Leonard & Bina Ellen Art Gallery presents an exhibition-forum on the research and creative work of Aboriginal Territories in Cyberspace.
A project by Jason Edward Lewis and Skawennati
With documentation from the Skins Workshops, selections from Illustrating the Future Imaginary and other research/creation projects, and a CyberPowWow reboot.
Filling in the Blank Spaces brings together, for the first time ever, over twenty years of programming and production by the research network Aboriginal Territories in Cyberspace (AbTeC) and its platform the Initiative for Indigenous Futures (IIF).
Through various media and events, the exhibition-forum animates a history of activities dedicated to developing Aboriginally-determined territories in cyberspace and imagining Indigenous peoples in the future. Filling in the Blank Spaces illustrates a multitude of ways Indigenous artists, researchers, educators, designers and community activists are creating and employing new media to strengthen and complement their cultures and communities.
