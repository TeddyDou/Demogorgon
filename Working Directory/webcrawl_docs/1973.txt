Social and Cultural Analysis (PhD)
Doctorate (PhD)
Offered by:
Department of Sociology & Anthropology , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why pursue a Doctorate in Social and Cultural Analysis?
Carry out research that will enable you to address social inequities and dysfunctions. Perform cutting-edge fieldwork that raises questions about poverty, justice and access in diverse human societies around the world.
The PhD in Social and Cultural Analysis provides a unique bi-disciplinary structure where you will engage in multiple methodological approaches in anthropology and sociology. Studying alongside a diverse cohort of students, you will develop an ability to initiate independent research projects while cultivating an expertise in one of the following thematic specializations:
Globalization
Social inclusion and exclusion
Perception and representation
Justice and social ethics
Our distinguished faculty members include Canada and Concordia University Research Chairs, as well as Quebec’s first-ever Research Chair on Gambling . Active in multiple research centres and groups , such as the newly launched Milieux Institute for Arts, Culture and Technology , our faculty also act as co-ordinators at multiple research networks like the Masculinity Research Network, Sex Trade Advocacy and Research, and the Concordia Risk Studies Network.
Benefit from diverse Montreal neighbourhoods that provide good grounds to conduct anthropological and sociological fieldwork. The city is home to various cultural communities and organizations, making it an ideal location for you to work with certain groups and their members.

Comprehensive Examinations (12 credits). All candidates are required to write two 6-credit comprehensive exams (SOAN 850 and 860). The topics for these exams are set at the end of the first year and the exams completed within the second year of the program. Each comprehensive exam is assessed by a committee of three faculty members drawn from the two disciplines, and formed in consultation with the Graduate Program Director.
Thesis Proposal (3 credits). A candidate who has passed the comprehensive examinations must then submit a thesis proposal to the Graduate Program Director and the thesis committee (selected in consultation with the GPD). This proposal will be explained to, and defended before the thesis committee. If accepted, this constitutes the completion of SOAN 870 (3 credits).
Thesis (57 credits). The candidate who has passed the PhD comprehensive examinations and the thesis proposal will proceed to the final requirement. The thesis is expected to make an original contribution to knowledge, to be based on primary sources and to be presented in an acceptable literary form. The thesis will demonstrate knowledge of theories and methods associated with each discipline. The thesis will normally be no more than 400 pages in length in total. Subject to the approval of the GPD and the thesis committee, a component of the thesis can take the form of a film or CD Rom.
Language Requirement. Given that the bulk of the literature in the two disciplines is written in English and French, reading assignments are given in both languages. Students are required to work towards reading proficiency very quickly. Upon completion of their coursework, students are required to demonstrate reading proficiency in both languages before being permitted to begin the thesis portion of their program. The proficiency level is verified through the administration of a translation test at the end of the coursework period.
In addition, students whose research topic requires the knowledge of a third language will be expected to take the necessary courses and demonstrate proficiency in that language before embarking on their research.
Admission requirements
Admission Requirements. The normal requirement for admission to the PhD in Social and Cultural Analysis is a Master of/Magisteriate in Arts in sociology or in anthropology, with a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.00, from a recognized university. A superior academic record and strong references are both essential. The intended area of research is also a factor as admission is contingent on the availability of an appropriate research supervisor. Applicants who do not have the required background in either one of the disciplines will be required to take courses (undergraduate or graduate) before being admitted into the program. The number of credits required will vary depending on the student’s personal background but will be limited to no more than 24 credits.
Proficiency in English. Applicants whose primary language is not English must demonstrate that their knowledge of English is sufficient to pursue graduate studies in their chosen field. Please refer to the  Graduate Admission page  for further information on the Language Proficiency requirements and exemptions.
