Creative Writing (BA)
Bachelor of Arts (BA)
Offered by:
Department of English , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why study Creative Writing?
Our Creative Writing program, one of the first of its kind in Canada, immerses you in every aspect of the writing life, from the development of ideas to the publication of finished works. As a Creative Writing student, you’ll learn to approach literature from a writer’s point of view as you develop your own craft under the guidance of published writers and fellow students.
Whether it’s through prose, poetry, or drama, our workshops help you find your voice and your subject. Creative writing students also have the opportunity to supplement their regular courses with master classes conducted by internationally renowned writers during the Writers Read at Concordia  series. Concordia has hosted writers such as Colm Tóibín, Julian Barnes, Jorrie Graham, Mark Strand, Miriam Toews and George Saunders.
Montreal’s vibrant English-language literary scene offers a showcase for the work of student writers as well as published authors. The skills acquired in our Creative Writing program can help prepare you for a professional life as a writer, editor, or publisher in print or in electronic media. The Honours in English and Creative Writing is a gateway to graduate study in literature or to further study in creative writing.
