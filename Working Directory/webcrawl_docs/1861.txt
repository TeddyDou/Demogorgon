Tenure-track position in South Asian religions, specialization in Hinduism
The Department of Religions and Cultures in the Faculty of Arts and Science at Concordia University seeks to hire a tenure-track faculty member working in the field of South Asian religions, with a specialization in Hinduism. The ideal candidate would be an historian of religions with an excellent research profile who is engaged with field work (for instance, ethnography or material culture), as well as textual study. Appropriate language abilities are expected, including competence in Sanskrit. The successful candidate will also demonstrate a strong commitment to teaching and research in gender, a signature area of the Department. Filling this position constitutes a renewal of the Chair in Hindu Studies at Concordia, with the opportunity to use the Hindu Studies endowment to support graduate studies in this area. The successful candidate will, therefore, have teaching experience and the ability to mentor graduate students. He or she will also complement existing strengths in Asian religions in the Department.
Concordia University is a vibrant research and teaching environment. Concordia is located in Montreal, Canada, which is a diverse and exciting city, ranked one of the best cities for overall quality of living in North America.
Applications must consist of a cover letter, a current curriculum vitae, a statement of teaching philosophy/interests, a research statement, evidence of teaching effectiveness if applicable, and a sample of published research. Candidates should also have three letters of reference emailed directly to the address below. All application materials should be sent directly via email to:

Subject to budgetary approval, we anticipate filling this position at the rank of Assistant Professor for August 1, 2018; however, appointments at a higher rank will be considered. Applications should be received by Friday, October 20, 2017. All inquiries about the position should be directed to Dr. Carly Daniel-Hughes, Chair of the Department of Religions and Cultures: chairreligionsandcultures@concordia.ca
Employment equity
All qualified candidates are encouraged to apply for this position; however, Canadians and Permanent Residents will be given priority. Concordia University is strongly committed to employment equity within its community, and to recruiting a diverse faculty and staff. The University encourages applications from all qualified candidates, including women, members of visible minorities, Indigenous persons, members of sexual minorities, persons with disabilities, and others who may contribute to diversification.
