Research interests
My research program explores the neural basisof human motor skill learning.  I use structural and functional neuroimaging techniques to examine the role of the cerebellum, striatum and motor cortical areas in the learning and retention ofmotor skills.  My work takes a broad developmental perspective, including studies in children and older adults, as well as individuals with musical training. I am a founding member of the Montreal Laboratory for Brain, Music and Sound (BRAMS), as well as the NSERC-funded training grant in Auditory Cognitive Neuroscience.  In addition, I am a member of the Scientific Committee of the Quebec Bio-imaging Network, as well as a member of the FRQ-funded Centre for Research in Human Development, the Centre for Research in Brain, Language and Music, and an associate member of the Centre for the Study of Behavioural Neurobiology.
