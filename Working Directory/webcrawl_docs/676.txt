Requesting Late Completion of course work
Application for Late Completion Grade
The deadlines for completion of course assignments are given to students on the first day of class. The “INC” notation is assigned when an instructor has agreed that a student may complete work after the deadline.
This application is to be completed by the student and brought to the Birks Student Service Centre (SGW-LB185) with payment of $25 of the application fee payable by money order or debit card (Interac). Application for Late Completion Grade form
If the course is still in progress you must ask your instructor to sign the form.
If a final grade has already been assigned for the course it must include an “INC” notation next to the grade. If a final grade has already been assigned to the course and no “INC” notation appears next to the grade then you must have the  instructor sign the form as this will indicate his agreement to grant a late completion.
A student with an “R” grade or “NR” notation in a course may not apply for late completion in that course.
Completed applications must be returned to the Birks Student Service Centre  by:
February 1:
Fall-term courses

Requesting Academic Re-evaluation of course work
Academic Re-Evaluation Request
You may request a re-evaluation of course work ( Academic Re-Evaluation Request form ) , which includes tests, examinations, essays and other work that has contributed to the grading of a course. It is assumed that initiating a formal re-evaluation is a last recourse, taken when prior and sincere attempts to resolve problems and disagreements informally and directly have failed.  See all details and procedures in the Undergraduate Calendar, section 16.3.9 .
The grounds for a re-evaluation request are restricted to claims that
a miscalculation of the grade occurred; or
the evaluation of the work was demonstrably unfair.
A grade may be maintained, raised or lowered as a result of a re-evaluation request.
Completed application is to be brought to the Birks Student Service Centre , SGW – LB 185 .
The fee is $40 payable by money order or debit card (Interac).
