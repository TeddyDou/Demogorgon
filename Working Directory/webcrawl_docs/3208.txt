Club Description: 
We are a young organization that aspires to help raise awareness and funds for Parkinson’s disease (PD) on the Concordia campus. As a club, we intend to inform Concordia students about the nature of disease and challenges that are being faced by the researchers. Furthermore, we have the intention to unite the students to raise awareness and donations to aid charities supporting people with Parkinson’s as well as biomedical researchers working on finding a cure for Parkinson’s.
Also, as exercise science students we are able to provide explanations of the impairments related to Parkinson’s in a way that is not intimidating to the general student body. Moreover, we plan to collaborate with the PERFORM Centre, this will allow us to spread awareness of the of the services currently offered by local sites.
