Government student aid programs
The Financial Aid and Awards Office helps students work with their government’s student financial aid program in order to pursue studies at Concordia. One very important thing to remember regardless of the program you are applying to:  students must apply every year and apply early – a minimum of 6 to 8 weeks before the beginning of the semester in order to receive their funding in time for the start of term.
Don’t wait – follow the links below to find your government’s program and get started:
Loans and bursaries
Government of Quebec
The most current application is available to you online at the the Aide financière aux études  website where you will find the latest financial aid information for Quebec residents.
When filling out an application for Quebec's Loan and Bursary program, you will need:
Concordia's school code which is 980000
Your Program codes and 
Your  definition of full-time studies
If you contact us, we can confirm your registration to Aide finaciers aux etudes (AFE).
Concordia also offers a Work Study Program to assist full-time students who are in financial need to pursue their academic goals by providing part-time employment on campus. 
Notice of AFE update
We would like to inform you of an AFE service upgrade for students borrowing through AFE’s full time student loan program.  Effective May 16th, 2016 students who are full time or deemed full time will have direct access to their Certificate of Guarantee through their AFE online portal.  As a reminder, the Certificate of Guarantee is your loan agreement with the government and your financial institution and is required to obtain your loan.
To obtain and print your Certificate, log on to your Aide Financière aux Études online portal.  In the “Notice” section of your file, a message will indicate that a Certificate of Guarantee has been issued as a result of a full-time status confirmed by your school. It will direct you to print your Certificate. Once you have printed your Certificate, you can present it to one of the participating financial institutions in order to complete the loan process. 
Certificates of Guarantee for students borrowing through AFE’s part time student loan program will continue to be sent in paper format to the university.
For more information, please contact Aide financière aux études directly. You can also contact the Financial Aid and Awards Office by emailing fundingyoureducation@concordia.ca. We are here to help you.
 
Canadian federal and other provincial resources
As a graduate or undergraduate student who is a permanent resident or Canadian citizen, find out if you are eligible for government student aid  in your respective province or through the federal government.
 
U.S. student loans
We work with you and your parents to determine your eligibility for different types of loans based on US federal guidelines.
