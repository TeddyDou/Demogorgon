Club Description: 
The Concordia University Young Greens are the Green Party of Canada's official ambassadors to Concordia University
We, as Concordia students, believe in a smart economy, strong communities and true democracy. 
Through small efforts, sustainable alternatives and political strategies with tomorrow's best interest in mind, we hope to make a difference.
The Concordia Young Greens believe in positive political change and we believe that we can help put green values into practice through federal legislation. We cherish the core values of the Green Party of Canada: ecological wisdom, social justice, participatory democracy, non-violence, sustainability and respect for diversity. We recognize the interconnectedness of all life forms and the importance of sustainable living for the future of our country, and of our world.
The campus club will benefit the Concordia community because it will enable students and faculty who are interested in advancing environmental issues in the political arena to find each other and to join forces with their peers. We encourage the participation of youth in public affairs and we offer students an opportunity for direct participation in the political process.
