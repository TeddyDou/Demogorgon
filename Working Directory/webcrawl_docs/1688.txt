How eMentoring works on Concordia Alumni Connect
Mentors
When you enable the mentor status on your Concordia Alumni Connect profile, it will appear in mentor search results.
You select which mentoring services youâ€™re willing to offer:
Provide advice via email or chat
Set up a phone call
Review a CV/cover letter
Organize a workplace visit or job shadowing session
Organize an in-person meeting
When someone selects you as a mentor, you will receive a notification message and will be asked to accept or decline the request.
Mentees
When you search for a mentor, you can set preferences for industry, faculty, or geographic location, allowing you to find the perfect match from a wide variety of results.
