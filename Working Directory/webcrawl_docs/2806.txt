Recurring Martian Streaks: Flowing Sand, Not Water?
Dark features on Mars previously considered evidence for subsurface flowing of water are interpreted by new research as granular flows, where grains of sand and dust slip downhill to make dark streaks, rather than the ground being darkened by seeping water.
Continuing examination of these still-perplexing seasonal dark streaks with a powerful camera on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) shows they exist only on slopes steep enough for dry grains to descend the way they do on faces of active dunes.
The findings published in Nature Geoscience argue against the presence of enough liquid water for microbial life to thrive at these sites. However, exactly how these numerous flows begin and gradually grow has not yet been explained. Authors of the report propose possibilities that include involvement of small amounts of water, indicated by detection of hydrated salts observed at some of the flow sites.

NASA: Mars' strange streaks might not be water after all
We've got some big questions about #Mars , but one of its most compelling mysteries just got a lot more intense. "Recurring slope lineae" (RSL) are dark streaks, first #discovered in 2011, that appear seasonally on parts of the Mars landscape. In 2015, researchers took #RSL as evidence of active salt water flows on the red planet. In 2017, new findings suggest RSL may actually be from shifting sand and dust.

#MarsExpress monthly image drop!
These striking features on #Mars were caused by the planet‚Äôs crust stretching apart in response to ancient #volcanic activity.
The fractures in the Sirenum Fossae region in the southern hemisphere were imaged by ESA‚Äôs Mars Express in March. They extend for thousands of kilometres in length, far beyond the boundaries of this image.
