Volunteering
The LIVE Centre is Concordia's on-campus Volunteer Resource Centre, your one-stop shop for information about volunteerism on and off campus. 
Many Concordia students enrich their university experience by volunteering. Volunteering allows you to support a cause you care about and gain valuable experience. Volunteer Ambassadors at the Volunteer Resource Centre can help you navigate through hundreds of volunteer opportunities and find the one that's right for you!
