Dorothy Mikalachki, BA 59, vividly recalls the day she met the late Henry F. Hall, principal of Sir George Williams University (1957 to 1962), who oversaw one of Concordia’s two founding institutions. Before that encounter, Mikalachki didn’t think she’d achieve her dream of attending university — a far-off goal given her family’s difficult financial circumstances.
Thanks to a scholarship granted by Hall, Mikalachki gained entrance to university. She made the most of every Georgian moment, developed a strong appreciation for learning and even met her future husband, Al Mikalachki, BA 58.
Dorothy Mikalachki has given back to her alma mater by making a planned gift. Her generosity ensures the next generation of students can enjoy the same opportunities she had. Planned gifts, oftentimes called legacy giving or living bequests, can support undergraduate scholarships, graduate fellowships, faculty chairs, research, infrastructure and more.
A planned gift can enable you to make a more significant contribution than you thought possible, while allowing you to achieve financial and tax benefits that help fulfill your philanthropic and estate-planning goals. At Concordia, we have a myriad of planned giving options from which you can choose.
