FIELD SCHOOL IN CRITICAL MUSEOLOGY
How can museums enhance democracy, belonging, and dialogue about national and global heritage? 
May 15–27, 2017
This field school exposes students to the most current approaches to "critical museology" theory via discussion of decolonizing approaches, human rights and social justice mandates, and the ways that museum architecture, digital technologies, and forms of implicit and explicit pedagogy allow or inhibit encounters with "difficult knowledge."
Students benefit from a curriculum developed by leading experts in the field, complemented with guided “behind the scenes” field-study visits to Montreal museums, to address current issues, challenges, and areas of innovation in the rapidly changing world of museums.
Hosted at Concordia's  Curating and Public Scholarship Lab , participants join an international network of peers to learn, debate, and design their own “curatorial dream” to present to an international, specialist audience during the  Museum Anthropology Futures  conference at the end of the course.
