Club Description: 
Concordia Outdoors was originally founded with sailing as the main priority. Since then, it has developed into a club that lives and breathes for the great outdoors. Our execs are dedicated to finding the best hiking, camping, swimming, rock climbing and sailing opportunities that the Northeast region of North America has to offer. We usually produce about 8-9 hiking trips until snow fall, one chalet trip per semester and lots of winter activities such as ice skating, sledding and our now annual trip to Ottawa to enjoy the capital. Our trips and activities are open to everyone (non-Concordia persons are welcome to join) and we encourage a healthy lifestyle. Come visit us at our office hours (you can find them on our Facebook page) or shoot us an email if you would like to know more!
