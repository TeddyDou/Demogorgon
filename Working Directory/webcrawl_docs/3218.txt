Club Description: 
The sole purpose of Cupcakes for a Cause is to raise awarness by doing fundraisers for local Montréal charities through the form of cruelty-free sweet indulgences (vegan). While other bake sales may only be focused on raising money for their particular cause, we are focused on raising money to help local charities in need such as animal shelters, homeless shelters, etc.
