This includes welding, soldering, cutting, brazing, grinding and drilling metal, using a torch and sanding in areas that are not pre-disposed for these activities.
The use of candles, smoke machines, plate warmers and cooking in locations without appropriate ventilation are also considered as hot work activities.
To conduct hot work at Concordia you must:
Complete the online fire prevention form.
Submit the form no less than 2 working days prior to the work or activity.

Establish a 11 meters / 35 foot safety zone and restrict its access to all non-essential personnel

Complete the online fire prevention form
Interruption of fire alarm or sprinkler systems
Hot work and maintenance will often result in the interruption or by-pass of a fire alarm or sprinkler system.  Even if a fire alarm system is by-passed, it continues to function however the audible alarms are silenced to avoid unnecessarily evacuating a building due to a planned activity.  Fire alarms are always received and investigated even when the alarm is by-passed.
The interruption, bypass or closure,  in part or in full of any fire alarm or sprinkler system must only be undertaken by authorized, University trades personnel or authorized external fire alarm and/or sprinkler service providers.  The online, fire prevention form must be completed no less than 2 working days prior to the scheduled interruption of fire alarm and/or sprinkler systems.
Any sprinkler valves that are closed during repairs or for maintenance must be identified with the designated "fire protection out of service" warning sign. Warning signs are available at the nearest building security or by calling 514-848-3717.
University Fire Prevention Personnel may impose, a fire watch/monitor or other precautions judged to be necessary for the duration of the fire protection systems interruption.
Any cost associated with special requirements, precautions or equipment and/or university charges related to the interruption of fire protection systems are the responsibility of the person responsible for coordinating the work.
The person responsible for the interruption of fire alarm and/or sprinkler systems may be subject to fees/fines of up to $3000.00, due to negligence and/or not adhering to the established conditions and/or precautions established by University Fire Prevention Personnel, resulting in a false alarm / building evacuation and/or the response of  the Montreal Fire Department.
University Fire Prevention Personnel are authorized to inspect the work site and if necessary, stop all activity if the established requirements and/or precautions  have not been adhering to or if any other safety or fire risk is identified.
Anyone not authorized to and tampers with fire alarm or sprinkler systems will be subject to severe internal consequences and potentially criminal charges.
