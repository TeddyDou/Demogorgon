Adult Education (GrDip)
Graduate Diploma (GrDip)
Offered by:
Department of Education , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why pursue a Graduate Diploma in Adult Education?
The Graduate diploma in Adult Education is designed to enhance the practice of adult education (Andragogy) through the provision of formal study in the theoretical foundations, methods, techniques and problem solving for the professional adult educator working in a variety of settings.
You may specialize in an area of your own professional goals by selecting courses which reflect this interest.  This program is an equally optimal entry for mature students returning to graduate work and who want to gain familiarity with graduate level studies before committing to a Master in Educational Studies program.
Join a diverse student body, originating from Québec, Canada and internationally, that is comprised of working professionals, educators and administrators in public and private schools, business and advertising managers and nurse educators among others.

The GSDE is a student-run conference and offers you the opportunity to learn more about presenting at an academic conference, grant applications and event planning.

Transferring from Adult Education (GrDip) to Educational Studies (MA)
The courses offered for the Diploma in Adult Education (ADIP) are cross-listed with either the third year level undergraduate (ADED/ADIP) courses or with the graduate ESTU courses (ADIP/ESTU).  Therefore, the students who want to consider making a move to the MA in Educational Studies (ESTU) with the Adult Education concentration option are advised to take the courses cross-listed with ESTU (ADIP/ESTU).
