PhD Oral Exam - Meghrig Terzian, Computer Science
On Near Optimal Time and Dynamic Delay and Delay Variation Multicast Algorithms
December 1, 2017, 10:30 a.m. – 1:30 p.m.
When studying for a doctoral degree (PhD), candidates submit a thesis that provides a critical review of the current state of knowledge of the thesis subject as well as the student’s own contributions to the subject. The distinguishing criterion of doctoral graduate research is a significant and original contribution to knowledge.
Once accepted, the candidate presents the thesis orally. This oral exam is open to the public.
Abstract
Multicast is one of the most prevalent communication modes in computer networks. A plethora of systems and applications today rely on multicast communicationto disseminate traffic including but not limited to teleconferencing, videoconferencing, stock exchanges, distance learning, supercomputers, software update distribution,distributed database systems, and gaming.
This dissertation elaborates and addresses key research challenges and problems related to the design and implementation of multicast algorithms. In particular, it investigates the problems of (1) Designing near optimal multicast time algorithms for mesh and torus connected systems, and (2) Designing efficient algorithms for Delay and Delay Variation Bounded Multicast (DVBM).
To achieve the first goal, improvements on four tree based multicast algorithms are made: Modified PAIR (MPAIR), Modified DIAG (MDIAG), Modified MIN (MMIN), and Modified DIST (MDIST). Bounds on the time generated by the modified algorithms is given and the proof that MDIAG generates optimal or optimal plus one multicast time in 2-Dimensional (2D) mesh networks is provided. In attempt to tackle the disadvantages of centralized routing, the hybrid version of MDIAG is designed, that gives a 3-additive approximation algorithm on multicast time in 2D torus networks. To make HMDIAG applicable on systems using higher dimensional meshes and tori, HMDIAG is extended and the proof that it gives a (2n-1)-additive approximation algorithm on multicast time in n-Dimensional (nD) torus networks is given.
To address the second goal, Directional Core Selection (DCS) algorithm for core selection and DVBM Tree generation is designed. To further reduce the delay variation of trees generated by DCS, a k-shortest-path based algorithm, Build Lower Variation Tree (BLVT) is designed. To tackle dynamic join/leave requests to the ongoing multicast session, the dynamic version of both algorithms is given that responds to dynamic requests by reorganizing the tree and avoiding session disruption. To solve cases where single-core based algorithms fail to construct a DVBM tree, a dynamic three-phase algorithm, Multi-core DVBM Trees (MCDVBMT) is designed, that semi-matches group members to core nodes.
