Research interests
Our  ongoing research investigates the medically important fungal pathogen Candida  albicans, with the ultimate goal of identifying new treatment options for  patients suffering from Candida infections. We use an array of genetic and  genomic approaches to investigate pathways involved in various C. albicans functions. As part of these efforts we collaborated with various international  research teams in the assembly and annotation of the C. albicans genome.  We are now using genome-based tools such as transcriptional profiling and  ChIP-chip analysis to investigate regulatory circuits in the pathogen. We have  identified dramatic cases of transcriptional rewiring of central metabolic  pathways, synchronized cells and established the transcriptional profile of the C. albicans cell cycle, and  investigated the regulation of the fungal mating system. We are also screening an  extensive library of conditional C.  albicans mutants using various physiological and chemical treatments  through the functional Genomics robotic facility at Concordia. This will allow  us to explore, tailor, and understand the subtleties that make C. albicans a human pathogen.
