Idea Cafe - Enhancing Health and Wellbeing at Concordia
November 23, 2017, 9:30 a.m. – 11:30 a.m.
The university is currently reviewing practices and services that support student health and wellbeing.
As part of the review, we are hosting three idea cafes to invite students, staff, and faculty to share their ideas and recommendations on what the university can do to enhance student health and wellbeing.
This Café will ask the following questions:
What opportunities for personal development can nurture a student’s holistic growth and well-being?
What kind of connections to campus can best sustain a sense of belonging and well-being?
