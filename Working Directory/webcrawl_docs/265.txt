University of the Streets Café
University of the Streets Café is a program of the Office of Community Engagement at Concordia University. It organizes bilingual, public conversations in cafés and community spaces across Montreal.
About
Our participatory events seek to reinvent the idea of the ‘university’ by creating spaces for lifelong learning, critical thinking and community engagement in local neighbourhoods.
Methodology  
A public conversation is much like a conversation you’d have with friends or family around a dinner table, except with more people, more points of view, and slightly more structure.
Get involved
Thanks to the support of our volunteers , venues and parterning organizations , the program is free and open to participants of all ages, backgrounds and levels of education.
FAQs
What language are the events in? Do I need to register? What is the cost, and answers to other important questions.  
Fall 2017: Private Choices / Public Impact schedule
In the context of our collective investment in a shared landscape, private choices inevitably lead to public impact. This season’s University of the Streets Cafe conversations will strive to consider how these decisions - made in the context of the personal realm - slowly trickle up, coalescing into the boundaries of our cultures and communities. Do we hold the power to change our world? If so, how? We encourage you to draw your own links between these conversations or to experience them individually.
Accessibility
We strive to hold all of our public conversations in venues that are accessible to persons with limited mobility. Contact us to find out more about the accessibility details or for any accessibility-related questions and/or needs.
