Aleksandr Satellite
Short Summary
Aleksandr is the name of Space Concordia’s second and third entry in the Canadian Satellite Design Challenge. Its mission is to study the long-term performance of a new self-healing material in a microgravity environment. This new technology was developed by Dr Suong. V. Hoa, a professor at Concordia University. This self-healing material is of high interest for the aerospace community due to the benefits it can provide for future spacecraft. If a self-healing shield were to be implemented on a spacecraft structure, it would provide a shield from micro-particle impact, thus dramatically increasing its mission lifetime.
