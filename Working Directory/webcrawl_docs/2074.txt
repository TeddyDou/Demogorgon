Community, Public Affairs and Policy Studies (BA)
Bachelor of Arts (BA)
Offered by:
School of Community and Public Affairs , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why choose Community, Public Affairs and Policy Studies?
When you study public policy, policy advocacy and community economic development, you’ll graduate ready to jump into the policy-making process in private, public and community sectors.
Our bilingual program is energized by our students, who bring a diverse range of backgrounds and a broad spectrum of community experience to each class. You study in small, congenial groups and are encouraged to pursue another Arts or Science program at the same time.
Combining academics with activism strengthens your experience. You’ll hone your sensitivity to social, economic and political factors influencing the public policy process and explore such values as:
Social and economic justice
Equity
Participatory citizenship and democracy
Cultural pluralism
You integrate the theoretical with the practical. You can do an internship, and we ground our work through close relationships with community organizations, public and private institutions, and unions.

Course curriculum
Students of the School of Community and Public Affairs are strongly encouraged to pursue a departmental major of their choice. The combination of a disciplinary BA and the SCPA program provides maximum career flexibility for our graduates.
Students are required to maintain an overall average of B-. In addition, all members of the School of Community and Public Affairs are expected to participate fully in the operation of the School.
The School's student body is drawn primarily from the  Faculty of Arts and Science , although students from other Faculties can be admitted. Students are therefore exposed to various disciplines through interaction with their peers.
Please note: Students who take one or more of the required courses as part of their degree program must replace the credits with a course chosen in consultation with the SCPA advisor. Under special circumstances, a student may replace one of the elective courses with a course chosen in consultation with the SCPA advisor.

Internship
The policy process cannot be conveyed successfully without access to a “real world” laboratory. Hence, the BA Major in Community, Public Affairs and Policy Studies emphasizes practical experience to help students develop the judgment necessary to complement traditional academic training. Drawing on an innovative combination of theory and practice, the SCPA helps its students to become familiar with the fundamental intellectual tools that will enable them not only to formulate their own educated critique of their sociopolitical environment, but also to participate actively and knowledgeably in the improvement of that environment.
The internship is an important training ground. Because it demands active and imaginative responses, the internship experience is an opportunity to test theory and formulate new approaches. In addition, this period of practice is a time when our students can familiarize members of the larger community with our program, its aims and its achievements.
Support for our internship is consistently positive. Government, business and community leaders have been helpful in advising and placing our students. The experience is one that adds a very important practical dimension to our program. Success in an internship enhances a student's potential, whatever career path is chosen.
