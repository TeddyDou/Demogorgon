Undergraduate admissions
Check the requirements
Follow the steps below to prepare your application to Concordia:
1. Check minimum admission requirements
The minimum admission requirements depend on what type of student you are:
Quebec students
Students from all other parts of Canada
International students  (students from outside Canada) 
Mature students
Transfer students
Or, the minimum admission requirements could depend on your specific situation:
Independent students
Returning students
Visiting students
2. Check program-specific requirements
Some programs require you to provide additional documents that you should mail directly to the department. It is your responsibility to verify if your program has additional requirements (e.g., letters of intent, portfolios, interviews, auditions and specific deadlines).
3. Check language requirements
Determine if you must include proof of English proficiency with your application.
Check our  English language proficiency requirements .
 
4. Gather supporting documents
All applicants must include the following documents:
Transcripts
Please upload unofficial copies of transcripts when you apply to Concordia because it speeds up the review of your application.
Uploaded transcripts, however, are not official transcripts. Official transcripts are documents sent directly from an institution to our Admissions Application Centre. Unless otherwise specified, we request official transcripts only once you are admitted.
Quebec Cegep applicants
If you include your permanent code on your application, you do not need to provide a copy of your Cegep transcript. Your permanent code allows us to obtain your official transcripts from the Conférence des recteurs et des principaux des universités du Québec (CREPUQ).
Ontario high school applicants
Ontario Universities’ Application Centre (OUAC): If you also applied to an Ontario university, you have an OUAC number and the OUAC will provide us with your high school transcripts.
Include a valid OUAC number for the current year in your web application
Winter term exception: OUAC does not send transcripts in the winter term. If you apply to Concordia for a winter term, please upload a copy of your transcript
If you didn’t apply through OUAC, please upload a copy of your transcript 
Other Canadian provinces/United States applicants
Upload copies of transcripts from all previous educational institutions.
If you are currently enrolled in school:
Submit the results of previous terms and a list of your current courses
Include mid-year grades if they’re available 
International applications
Upload a copy of your transcripts from all previous educational institutions
If you’re currently enrolled in school:
Submit the results of previous terms and a list of current courses you are currently registered in
Include mid-year grades if they’re available
All transcripts should be in the original language
Translation requirement: If your official transcript is in neither English nor French, submit a copy translated into English or French by a certified translator. Notarial certificates are not accepted.
Transfer applicants from colleges/universities
Upload a copy of your transcripts from any post-secondary institutions, indicating any courses in progress.
If you have not completed a full year of university or college studies at the time of application, you should also upload transcripts from previous educational institutions.

the name and address of the school

a stamp or other notice indicating that it contains official transcripts
If you submit the envelope unopened, the transcript will be considered as official.
Proof of status in Canada

To prove Canadian citizenship or permanent resident status, submit a clear photocopy of one of the following documents:
Quebec birth certificate issued by the Quebec Directeur de l'état civil
(see Concordia’s description for  Quebec Residency Guidelines ) 
Canadian birth certificate (if born outside Quebec)
Canadian citizenship card (both sides)
Permanent resident card (both sides) or IMM 5292
We do not accept the following documents as proof of status in Canada:
Driver’s licence 
Medicare card 
Quebec baptismal certificate
Social Insurance Number card

A curriculum vitae
A birth certificate or other acceptable proof of age
School records and any documents which may indicate your ability to pursue university studies
