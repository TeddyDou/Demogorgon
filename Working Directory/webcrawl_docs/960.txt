Rohingya in Peril: Crisis in Myanmar
November 21, 2017, 12:30 p.m. – 2 p.m.
The Montreal Institute for Genocide and Human Rights Studies (MIGS) at Concordia University, in partnership with the Burma Task Force Canada, are organizing an event to explore the ongoing crisis in Myanmar/Burma. Since August over a half a million Rohingya people have been force to flee violence and seek protection in Bangladesh. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has called it a “textbook case of ethnic cleansing.”
This is a free event, but space is limited - please reserve your place online in advance.
Guest speaker: Dr. Maung Zarni
Dr. Zarni has been a human rights activist for nearly 30 years and is a regular commentator on BBC News and Al-Jazeera on the Myanmar Crisis. He is a non-resident fellow with the (Genocide) Documentation Center - Cambodia, The Sleuk Rith Institute, specializing in racism and genocides. He has written extensively on democratization, Islamophobia and Rohingya genocide in his native country of Burma, and served as a member of the panel of judges at the Permanent Peoples Tribunal (PPT) on Sri Lanka (2013) & initiated the PPT on Myanmar the same year. He was educated at the University of Mandalay (Burma), the University of California-Davis, the University of Washington and holds a PhD from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He taught at National-Louis University in Chicago, and has held teaching, research, leadership or visiting fellowships at the London School of Economics, Oxford University, Harvard University, UCL-Institute of Education, Georgetown University, and the Rockefeller Foundation.
He founded the internet-based Free Burma Coalition in 1995, and led the grassroots campaign until 2004. For his contributions to the interfaith human rights activism worldwide, the Parliament of the World's Religions honoured him with its biannual "Cultivation of Harmony Award" in 2015. For his opposition to Myanmar genocide, the Burmese government has denounced him as "national traitor" and "enemy of the State."
