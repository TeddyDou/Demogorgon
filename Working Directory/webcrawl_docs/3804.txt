Are you a first or second year student? Have you considered becoming a CPA? Do you wonder what it’s really like to be a CPA?
JMAS extends to you the opportunity to shadow a Partner or a Manager for 1 day at one of Montreal’s top Accounting firms! We have partnered up with the following firms to offer you the chance to spend a day in their shoes: KPMG, PWC, EY, Nexia Friedman, Collins Barrow, Richter, PSB Boisjoli & RSW.
How can you get involved?
In the nature of making this fun – JMAS has organized a 1 day internal Case Competition where teams of 4 students will be given 3 hours to solve and prepare a solution to an interesting case! The case will incorporate introductory Accounting theories and strategic management skills. Students will then present their recommendations in front of an independent panel of judges, where they will be evaluated on the quality of their solution, as well as analytical and presentation skills.
Winners will be announced at our Winter Cocktail networking event where all team are welcome to participate and network with firm representatives on Wednesday, January 28.
