English and Creative Writing (BA)
Bachelor of Arts (BA)
Offered by:
Department of English , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why study English and Creative Writing?
Immerse yourself in the writing life – and develop a cultural vocabulary – by looking at the human condition through many literary modes, while studying works which include aspects of psychology, history, and philosophy. The Honours in English and Creative Writing program allows you to both work on your craft as a creative writer, and develop a broad context in which to see your own writing through the academic study of English Literature. 
The combined English and Creative Writing degree offers you a rare balance between creative and scholarly environments. Studying literature will sharpen your abilities as a critical reader, thinker and writer, and invite you to imagine alternative worlds and perspectives. As a writer, you can start to create those realms yourself.
Our writing program is one of the best and most established in the country. Students have the opportunity to supplement their regular courses with master classes conducted by internationally renowned writers and by participating in one of the department’s literary journals .
