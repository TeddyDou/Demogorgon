Anthropology and Sociology (BA)
Bachelor of Arts (BA)
Offered by:
Department of Sociology & Anthropology , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why study Anthropology and Sociology?
Expand your notion of what it means to become a person in Canada and around the world by examining the many ways peoples, past and present, have organized the activities, institutions and belief systems that sustain social life. The Joint Specialization in Anthropology and Sociology allows you to observe and investigate cultural life in diverse societies while acquiring the training you need to apply social science methods to large-scale research projects. By taking a critical look at social problems and social change, you will enhance your thinking about the reasons for poverty, prejudice, crime and conflict. You’ll be able to apply our methods to nearly any place in the world, and any topic — from medicine, art and myth to human rights, sexuality, justice and power. A Joint Specialization in Anthropology and Sociology will equip you to make positive and effective social change in our society and around the world.
