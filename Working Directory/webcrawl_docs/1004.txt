The Graduate Attribute Assessment System  (GAAS) web application enables the recording of graduate attribute assessment as required by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board. For the purposes of the AAS system, each term, every department assigns a set of courses that measure graduate attributes. These courses are said to participate in the AAS system. For each participating course, the department specifies which attributes are assessed in that course.
