Research interests
Our research indentifies pathways to successful living across the adult lifespan. We examine from a self-regulation perspective how people can adjust to challenging life circumstances and prevent the adverse consequences on their psychological, biological, and physical health (e.g., depression, cortisol dysregulation, or chronic disease). This research program integrates theories from personality, developmental, and health psychology, and is based on the premise that there are reliable individual differences in people’s personality processes that determine the quality of life of individuals who confront problematic life situations.
