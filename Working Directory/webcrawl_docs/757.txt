Off the Shelf in Sherbrooke: Rod MacLeod & Heather Darch
November 23, 2017, 7 p.m. – 9 p.m.
Version française
This event looks at stories involving both conflict and community-building in Quebec's English-speaking community. Heather Darch, curator of the Missisquoi Museum , will look at the impact of the Fenian Raids of 1866 and 1870 on the border regions of Quebec. Rod MacLeod, who co-authored the authoritative history of Quebec’s Protestant educational system , will ponder the heritage and continuing challenges surrounding English-language schools in the province, which are key community cornerstones.
This event is free and open to the general public. No registration required.
The Off the Shelf lecture series, co-organized by  QUESCREN , also includes events in Montreal and Quebec City . It aims to promote our online bibliography on English-speaking Quebec produced in collaboration with Brendan O'Donnell (new version coming soon).
Notre événement sherbrookois jettera un œil sur des histoires racontant à la fois les conflits et la construction communautaire au sein de la société anglo-québécoise. Heather Darch, conservatrice du Musée Missisquoi , s’intéressera à l’impact des raids féniens de 1866 et de 1870 sur les régions frontalières du Québec. Roderick MacLeod, corédacteur d’un ouvrage sur l’histoire du système éducatif protestant au Québec , examinera le legs des écoles de langue anglaise de la province – véritables pierres angulaires des communautés – et les défis auxquels elles continuent de faire face.
Cet événement est gratuit et ouvert au public. Aucune inscription requise.
La série Off the Shelf, co-organisée par  QUESCREN , comporte également des évènements à Québec et à Montréal . Elle vise à promouvoir notre bibliographie en ligne qui recense les sources sur le Québec d’expression anglaise établie en collaboration avec le bibliographe Brendan O’Donnell (nouvelle version à venir bientôt).
