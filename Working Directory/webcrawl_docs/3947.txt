Mission
 
The M&A Club was founded in 2009 to facilitate deal making and financings in the mid-market private sector between M&A professionals. Each of the 14 clubs in Quebec, Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia hold 10 Round Table meetings per year where members propose and discuss their deals with each other in strict confidentiality.
$600 million in closed transactions
 
An informal polling of members confirms that well over $600 million in closed transactions and financings have been attributed directly to M&A meetings and the all day M&A Forums since 2009.
