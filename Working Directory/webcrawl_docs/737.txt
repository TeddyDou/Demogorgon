Sightings 22 - A est a si A is a est A | Lecture by Marie Cherbat-Schiller
November 22, 2017, 6 p.m. – 7:30 p.m.
The Leonard & Bina Ellen Art Gallery presents a lecture by Marie Cherbat-Schiller, a member of Marion Lessard, in conjunction with the Sighting project A est a si A is a est A, on view until December 21.
During this presentation, Marie Cherbat-Schiller returns to questions left unanswered by Claude Romain in his lecture on October 11, in addition to openly reflecting on the key issue of the ambient manifestations of ambivalence as expressed by the various forms of circumvolutive rejection of the contemporary subject when confronting the pathologizing/pathologized projective expulsion of collective meta-structures, and all set within a perspective of decentralized framing of psychic economies in a context of organized disarray.
This lecture is made possible thanks to the support of ProCircex™ and will be given in French or in English, or in both languages.

Room VA-323, Visual Arts Building (1395 René Lévesque W.), Sir George Williams Campus
