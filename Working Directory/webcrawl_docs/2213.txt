My current research focuses on the syntactic and semantic properties of the different major clause types (Declaratives, Interrogatives, Imperatives and Exclamatives). In 2008 I published I-language: An Introduction to Linguistics as Cognitive Science  (Oxford University Press) with Concordia colleague Charles Reiss,  and I am currently working on a new monograph entitled The Morphosyntactic Ingredients of Force.  In 2006 I published a paper on the semantic nature of the determiner the. I manage an unruly household of four, including another linguist, a young child and a young adult.
