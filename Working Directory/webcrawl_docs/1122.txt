Do you dream of working for yourself one day?
Apply now for Concordia’s new Graduate Certificate in Entrepreneurship for non-business students
Posted on May 2, 2017

By: Yuri Mytko
More and more Canadians are opting to be their own boss. In 2016, according to Statistics Canada , 14.2 per cent of the country’s workforce was self-employed.
Concordia has created a new program at the John Molson School of Business to help non-business graduates work for themselves.
The Graduate Certificate in Entrepreneurship will welcome its first cohort in the fall 2017 term. It’s a short, focused program that will provide students with the skills and know-how to set up their own business.
Students can complete the 15-credit program on a part-time or full-time basis. In just two or three terms, they will get marketing and management basics, self-employment essentials and the knowledge they need to put together a successful business plan to set up and grow their micro-enterprise.
“We surveyed graduates from the Faculties of Fine Arts, Arts and Science and Engineering and Computer Science,” says director Anne Beaudry .  
“We found there was a real need for a program that can help young professionals and artists set up shop.”
Beaudry explains that when they designed the program, they had in mind graduates interested in setting up an artist-run studio or design firm.
“But then we saw that, in fact, there are many more people that a program like this could benefit: freelance writers and journalists, psychologists and therapists, the list goes on.”
Beaudry says that while self-employment can be incredibly fulfilling, individuals who work for themselves also face many challenges.
“There are certainly traps to avoid when you’re running your own enterprise. This program is meant to help young entrepreneurs anticipate potentially difficult situations and to have a plan in place that will ensure business success.”
The program is currently accepting applications for the fall 2017 term.
Listen to " Les Derangeants " to get the inside scoop on Quebec's next generation of business disruptors. Presented by Desjardins in collaboration with Concordia, the French podcast series is co-produced by six young Québécois entrepreneurs and the business newspaper Les Affaires.
Concordia’s new Graduate Certificate in Entrepreneurship  is now accepting applications. The next information session will be held on  Tuesday May 23 at 5:30 p.m. in MB 3.445.  Register here .
