Public Policy and Public Administration (MA)
Master of Arts (MA)
Offered by:
Department of Political Science , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why pursue a Master's in Public Policy and Public Administration?
Develop and apply advanced social science research to issues of democratic governance. Gain insight into analyzing complex political situations in order to provide expert strategic advice.
The MA in Public Policy and Public Administration provides an experiential learning environment where you will gain unparalleled access to academic and professional training to help you succeed in public sector organizations, including the public service and non-governmental organizations. Coursework and events organized through the Workshops of Social Science Research offer occasions to make valuable connections with political leaders, senior-level bureaucrats, judges, political pundits and academics, while developing skills in policy analysis and research methods.
Work alongside distinguished faculty members who regularly secure SSHRC grants, as well as other significant sources of external funding. Our researchers are currently engaged in various projects that receive financial support, including research focussing on gender mainstreaming, street-level bureaucracy and immigration policy. The Department of Political Science is also home to the Concordia University Research Chair in Aging and Public Policy .
Students enrolled in the internship option benefit from a four-month job placement in the public or private sector during the final semester of their studies. The majority of our students secure paid internships with government agencies in Ottawa and Montreal, but many others have found opportunities in Geneva, Washington, Prague and elsewhere around the world. Around 95 per cent of our internship students are bridged into full- or part-time positions immediately following their placement.
