Sparkling dew by gregor H 
We love your photos and we’re looking for new ways to promote you. Each week, we replace the Cover Photos (aka Hero Images) on our Flickr social media channels, so we thought, why not create a group and seek your submissions directly here .

Untitled by Berk Kır  
Via Flickr:
“Hevesleri, beklentileri, erteledikleri, kursağında kalmış kelimeleri, kaçırılmış bakışları, gizledikleri, bitirilmemiş mektupları, susuşları ve istemsiz veda edişleriyle tamamlanmamış bir cümledir insan.”
“A culled man who is not complete with his attitudes, anticipations, postponements, words left in his mouth, missed gazes, secrets, unfinished letters, silence, and involuntary farewells.”
