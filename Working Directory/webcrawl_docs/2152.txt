The Provincial Diversity Project
The Provincial Diversity Project is a research platform that aims at providing a better understanding of provincial unique realities in Canada in terms of identity and attachment, views about federalism, attitudes toward ethnic diversity and immigration, as well as views on social, economic and political issues in Canada.
The Provincial Diversity Project is a multicollaborative project led by Antoine Bilodeau (Concordia University) along with Luc Turgeon (Ottawa), Ailsa Henderson (Edinburgh) and Stephen E. White (Concordia). The Provincial Diversity Project is realized in collaboration with Léger Marketing and with the support of Concordia University, the Secrétariat aux affaires intergouvernementales canadiennes du Québec, the Canadian Network for Research on Terrorism, Security and Society, Elections Canada, the Institute for Research on Public Policy and the Chaire de recherche du Canada en études québécoises et canadiennes de l’UQAM.
The Provincial Diversity Project survey was conducted in the winter of 2014 among close to 10,000 Canadians through an internet survey conducted by Léger Marketing. The Provincial Diversity Project survey is composed of three legs.
The first leg of the project provides a portrait of Canadians in each province. Accordingly, more than 6400 Canadians were interviewed in all ten provinces. 1000 respondents were interviewed in each of Quebec, Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia. 500 Canadians were interviewed in each of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba and Saskatchewan, and 400 Canadians were interview in Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador.
The second leg of the project provides oversamples of visible minority Canadians in Quebec, Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia. 400 visible minority Canadians were interviewed in each of the four provinces.
Finally, the third leg of the project provides regional samples of young Canadians (aged 18 to 34). 350 young Canadians were interviewed in each of the following regions: the Atlantic, Ontario, the Prairies, and British Columbia. In addition, 500 young Canadians in Quebec were also interviews.
