Post 17 | Animation
Once again, it’s been a while since my last post. And, once again, this is because I have been so preoccupied with production that I’ve neglected posting updates. Eeek! But now I’m finally done shooting, 5 weeks later! Here is a bit of a recap.
Animating 
Since my last post, there have been tears and lots and lots of blood shed (mainly my puppet’s, only a bit of mine). However, in those few weeks of animation my animating skills have really improved significantly. Drawing from my experience at the Toronto Animated Image Society over the summer, with the great help of Toronto animator Evan DeRushie, I have learned to animate with more confidence. By this I don’t mean confidence in myself, but confidence in the puppet. In the past, and for past films, I’ve always been very gentle with my puppets. This might have saved them from breaking a lot of the time (for this film I have had a total of 7 armature breaks between two of the puppets!!), but it made the motion significantly more limited. Part of the reason I used to be such a timid stop motion animator was because I felt like I would have to move a body part so carefully so as not to move any of the rest of the body even a tiny bit. 
So here is the key, that I’ve learned, to animating stop motion. The key is to do whatever you want to your puppet without fear and to use the wonders of modern image capture softwares (I used Dragonframe) to keep the animation smooth. For example, with my newfound confidence I will gladly bend Lisa’s (my protagonist) toughly tempered elbow joint with full, thus moving her entire body a couple centimetres to the side, and then with reasonable ease adjust the position toggling in Dragonframe. Dragonframe is certainly a godsend (I hate to provide free advertisement! but…). For more subtle animation, featured in the GIF below, Dragonframe allows me to create semi-unplanned actions and make them look natural. For most shots, I made a general plan and let the puppet and my accidents guide the motion. The result is one of my smoothest shots below (filmed in front of a green screen, discussed in further detail below as well).
In spite of my newfound confidence, these few weeks of animating were truly filled with an amazing amount of stress and obstacles. The puppets kept on breaking, 2 second clips could end up taking 6 hours to shoot, cameras were knocked, lights suddenly burst: all the fun unexpected caveats to stop motion animation. However, most of my shots ended up looking good in the end, which makes all the stress worth it.
Animating liquids proved to be easier than expected. I tried to suppress my anxiety of animating all the blood in my film (which is in at least 40% of my shots) before I got to those shots. However, using a mix of food colouring and hair gel, animating blood ended up being quite therapeutic and successful. I almost wish I had used more liquids in the film, as it really helps to remind viewers that they are watching stop-motion, which I personally find important for stop motion films. Here is one of the shots of blood (though one with a bit simpler bloodnimation). #glamourshot!
I also tried to suppress my anxiety of animating the large scale (to be read as “normal scale” outside of the stop motion universe) shots. The shots I’m referring to are those using the large (human sized) hand puppets for hand action closeups (I mean take a look at Lisa’s hand in the GIF above and try to imagine how hideous it would be in closeup). I really put off making any of the props or details for this part because I wasn’t prepared to think about it. However, when I realized the time had come to think about this shot I realized that this cluster of shots would be my least painful! Animating in full scale is extremely satisfying and significantly easier to control (at least in my case). The resulting shots are perhaps some of my favourites: they are detailed, they somehow even look live action but with my puppet’s hands. I am very pleased with these shots. Here is a still:
I figured I had to at least once animate myself with my puppets. And because I was so pleased with how little hell these hand puppets gave me (compared to LISA, who aged me ten years!!!), I honoured them by acting with them. These puppets looked very scary outside of the camera because they were floating hands attache to wires. See the GIF:
Here are a few other fun shots of prepping for animation.
Another picture of me with Lisa sitting on a camera OmniSlider. I used the slider attached to both a tripod and a MagicArm to allow me to lock the camera in much deeper into the kitchen set. This particular arrangement was for a shot with a closeup of the fridge at the back of the kitchen.
Green Screen
I had animated using a green screen before for a past independent study, but that was without the pressure for the final footage to actually look good. This time I needed to make sure I did it right. For shots involving a character in the foreground that I wanted to easily be able to manipulate focus, and for shots that I needed to composite the Lisa puppet in the scene with herself, I shot in front of a green screen. In the studio space I was using there was a large spotty mixed green green screen for me to use. 
Setting up for green screen was much more time consuming than expected. Though After Effects Keylight green screen keying tool is pretty advanced these days, it was still difficult to evenly light a large green space using only two lights (the rest I needed for my puppets). Lighting the subjects to match the final shot was also a challenge that I may or may not have succeeded at….we’ll have to see in post production. The green screen set up took an absurd amound of space considering the size of my puppets. The animating table had to be far enough away so as not to get any green reflection. But because I was using a very wide 20mm macro lens, this meant that a huge part of the green screen wall was in the background of every shot. Here is my excessive setup, and then after a picture of the tiny (relatively) puppets in an NSFW position…
This shot was quite a challenge because the puppet were not on their feet but still had to be tied down verrrry well. The (not ideal but workable) solution was to use wires to bind down joints (ie by the knees, by the torso, by the elbow) in parts of the puppet that couldn’t be seen in camera. I also superglued one puppet’s hands to the other’s legs because sticky tack was being a pain in the ass, and this was the last shot so why not have the puppets forever making love….
So again, I am finally done shooting! This was a very intense but educational experience. I struggled a lot and learned a lot, and am very ready to begin post production!
Here is a final celebratory picture of me and my favourite hand puppet–the one that never betrayed me and always animated exactly how I wanted it!. We are together in front of the green screen.
