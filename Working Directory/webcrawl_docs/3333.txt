Shot Breakdown - Cam Pan Shot
Experimented with using 3D animation as a reference to do complex camera movement for the 2d animation.
*technically this is not a full pan since it’s half of the shot… :P

Shot Breakdown - Boom shot
This is gonna be the last shot breakdown of this film animation.
This shot was done pretty quickly since my deadline was drawing near. First time messing with smoke animations and again, used 3D animation as reference to do dynamic camera movements in a 2D animation.
Had the idea of making the buildings rise to make the protagonist look more trapped as the cannon got closer.
Also, used fish-eye effects on the shot. Thought it would look cool.

Shot Breakdown - “YOU’RE NOT GETTING AWAY!” shot
I wanted to do a scene where I can mess around with character expression and do some lip syncing.
This shot probably took me the longest, among any of the scenes of this animation. It’s pretty important to get the rough animation down before doing any clean up or else you’ll end up constantly fixing things.
Also doing the voice acting prior so you can time the lip sync properly. Save a lot of time by doing that.
Used After Effects to do the post camera movements to create more intensity into the shot.

Stills from my first year animation, Express Delivery
Last few months were a great experience! A lot of work but I think it paid off. Learned new ways of animating as well as learning from mistakes.
Had a lot of help from fellow animators and friends. Couldn’t have gotten this far without you guys.
Probably will post some other breakdown shots from this animation soonish. It be cool to present the progress.

It’s been a while! For any that are interested, I recently updated that Canti model I made years ago. Topology is a bit more efficient and textures are better! I’ll rig it one day
