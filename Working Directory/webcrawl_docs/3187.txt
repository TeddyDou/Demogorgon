Club Description: 
The purpose of this organization is to academically bridge the Department of Psychology at Concordia along with the John Molson School of Business, thus pooling intellectual talent, resources and academic interests towards the advancement of research in the field of Industrial and Organizational psychology. It is also important to note that interdepartmental bridging will be one of the main purposes of the Association. Further, informing and educating the University community with regards to the field and academic study of Industrial and Organizational Psychology. As an Association, using our intellectual capacity and resources to better the University and community where we are affiliated. Whereas, the mandate of this new association is to represent the ever expanding field of Industrial and Organizational Psychology at Concordia, given that it is currently underrepresented. Through association activities, we plan on educating the community and making available the tools necessary for our fellow students to pursue academic research, studies, graduate work and eventually careers in Industrial and Organizational Psychology. We plan on hosting workshops, information sessions, wine and cheeses, along with other networking opportunities. We welcome all students who are interested in psychology, management, organizational behaviour, industrial and organizational psychology, and human resources to contact us.
