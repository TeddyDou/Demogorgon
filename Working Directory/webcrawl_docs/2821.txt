Milia: How To Remove The Small White Skin Cysts?
Milia refer to a common skin condition marked by a group of small, white, hard, keratin-filled cysts, which form under the skin. They normally occur when keratin, a protein found in the tissues of the skin cells, hair and nails, becomes trapped below the skin surface. These cysts typically measure 1-2mm in diameter and normally appear on the area around the nose, eyes and cheeks. But, they can occur on other body parts too.

#Cysts in mouth are formed at the tip of the root of the inflamed or dead tooth. They are also formed around the crown of any tooth that are buried. The wisdom tooth that lies buried  fully has the risk to develop cysts around them.
Cysts associated with wisdom tooth are generally caused due to the inflammation of the tissues around the buried tooth. The cysts have the potential to affect the adjacent tooth, the surrounding bone and gum tissues. When a dentist finds out that such cysts are present, the immediate solution is to extract the wisdom tooth and remove the cysts and medicate it.
