Craig Buntin
CEO, SPORTLOGiQ
CRAIG BUNTIN, CEO of  SPORTLOGiQ , is coming to  #JMSM17 !
A prolific figure skater, Craig Buntin went on to represent Canada at the 2006 Olympics in Torino, Italy. He was a 3 time National Champion, 7 time national medalist and ranked 5th in the World. Upon finishing his athletic career, Craig went to McGill University where he was the first ever student in the history of the program to be accepted without an undergraduate degree.
In 2014 he went on to co-found SportLogIQ; an entirely new level of analysis to the sports analytics market. Using feeds from current broadcast cameras, the company uses player tracking and activity recognition to annotate player movement and provide context to game analysis. SPORTLOGiQ is a venture backed startup, having successfully secured significant seed financing to ensure the next 18 months of growth.
