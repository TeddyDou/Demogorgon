Try out a fresh look for YouTube
This new desktop design highlights your favorite videos and creators while making YouTube easier and more fun to use. We're still working on it, but we can't wait for you to try it out and let us know what you think!
Try new YouTube
YouTube has never looked better
Experience ultra-high-definition 4K videos, now playing on YouTube. These videos stream in up to 2160p—in other words, they offer stunning clarity and detail, whether you're here for Minecraft or makeup. To find 4K videos, do a search on YouTube, then click Filters > 4K, or check out this playlist of our favorite 4K videos .
And if playing 4K videos at 3840x2160 isn't enough to melt your device, try doing it at 60 frames per second. We've combined these two cutting-edge features for a few videos in this playlist . This feature may not work well on every device, but if you've got a powerful rig, try it out!
