Child Studies (BA)
Bachelor of Arts (BA)
Offered by:
Department of Education , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why choose Child Studies?
Enrich a child’s life through activities that engage and inspire them. Through a curriculum that combines theory and fieldwork, you’ll gain a strong foundation for working with children, with a broad knowledge base and the ability to:
foster the physical, emotional, psychological cognitive and academic development of preschool or school-age children;
understand children’s roles in family, community and cultural contexts;
meet the needs of children and families in preschool, inclusive and community education settings.
After graduating with practical experience and a well-rounded skill set, you’ll be recognized by Quebec’s Ministère de la Famille et des Aînes to work in preschool settings. Graduates of the program have also gone on to work as paraprofessionals in inclusive schools or rehabilitation settings. A degree in Child Studies is also a solid foundation for further professional training or graduate studies in teaching, occupational therapy, social work, educational psychology and speech and language psychology, among other fields.
