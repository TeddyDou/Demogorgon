Immigration guide for faculty

FAQ
Moving to Canada
For information on moving your goods to Canada, consult  these resources .
Setting up at Concordia
Our checklist  includes tips from getting an ID card to maneuvering around the city.
Work permits
Individuals who are neither Canadian citizens nor Canadian permanent residents must obtain a  work permit  to be allowed to work at Concordia University. We cannot pay anyone who is not legally entitled to work in Canada.
Social insurance numbers
Once in Canada, individuals must apply for a temporary  social insurance number  at the branch office of Service Canada that serves their local area of residence.
Health insurance
Individuals who are new to Québec should apply for  provincial health insurance coverage  as soon as possible as there is a 3-month post-registration waiting period.
 
Income taxes
As soon as individuals commence employment, the appropriate  provincial and federal income taxes  will be deducted. The Québec government offers a  tax exemption  for up to five years for foreign-national and repatriated Canadian professors in designated disciplines.
Canadian permanent residency
In Québec, all applications for  permanent residence  status follow a two-step process: acquiring a certificat de sélection du Québec (CSQ) from the Province of Québec and getting federal approval from Citizenship and Immigration Canada.
