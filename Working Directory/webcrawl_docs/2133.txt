Women's Studies (BA, Cert)
Bachelor of Arts (BA), Certificate (Cert)
Offered by:
Simone de Beauvoir Institute , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why choose Women's Studies?
Women’s Studies is about examining the role of women in society both today and in the past, and recognizing their contributions to human achievement. You’ll learn to see women’s experiences through the lens of gender, race, class and sexual orientation. Study and research in Women's Studies adds an otherwise missing component to traditional scholarship. Women's Studies is also a way of moving away from the discriminatory language of race, sex, age, language or religion.
Offered through the Simone de Beauvoir Institute, the program is the oldest women’s studies program in Canada, and boasts a curriculum that explores historical and contemporary aspects of women’s oppression and resistance, including the experiences of marginalized women. You’ll also examine media representations of women and consumer culture, participate in Institute-sponsored lectures and develop initiatives that promote equality and social justice for all.
