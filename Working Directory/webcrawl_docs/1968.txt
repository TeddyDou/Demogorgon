Psychology (PhD)
Doctorate (PhD)
Offered by:
Department of Psychology , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why pursue a Doctorate in Psychology?
Deepen your understanding of psychological theories and advanced methodologies in psychological research as you make meaningful contributions to scientific knowledge and refine your skills in scientific writing. Participate in various colloquium series that will connect you with leading researchers from around the world.
The PhD in Psychology offers a research-intensive learning environment where you will develop into an expert in one of our department’s four broad areas of research, including behavioural neuroscience , clinical and health research , cognitive science , and human development and developmental processes . Work alongside research-active faculty members who have published in a multitude of prestigious journals, such as Psychological Review, Journal of Abnormal Psychology and American Psychologist, Science, and Nature.
Choose from one of two program options based on your own professional and academic objectives. Students in the Research Option receive advanced training in independent research, and are expected to publish articles on their research in scientific journals, and to present their findings at national and international scientific conferences. This option is well-suited for students who wish to pursue careers in research and academia.
The Research and Clinical Training Option involves the same requirements as the Research Option, and also provides professional training in the delivery of psychological services. Students enrolled in this option take part in the Concordia University Psychology Internship Programme , a year-long paid internship where students employ a range of techniques and theoretical orientations in a professional placement site. The option is also fully accredited by the Ordre des Psychologues du Quebec, as well as the Canadian Psychological Association.
Program details
Program options & degree requirements
Two program options exist. The Research Option emphasizes independent research and scholarship, and prepares students for research careers. Students in the Research and Clinical Training Option fulfill the same research requirements as other students, but also train to become mental health professionals.
Consult the graduate calendar for complete degree requirements.
Admission requirements
Admission Requirements. Admission to the PhD degree requires a master’s degree in psychology from a recognized university. Admission to the MA degree requires an honours degree in psychology or its equivalent. Enrolment in these programs is limited in part by the availability of research supervisors and, for the Research and Clinical Training Option, by space in that option.
Applicants are selected on the basis of past academic record, letters of recommendation, the results of the Graduate Record Examination (optional, but highly recommended), and the relevance of their proposed research to the research expertise of the faculty. Students successfully completing their master’s program in psychology at Concordia University need submit only an application form and letters of recommendation when applying for the doctoral degree. Psychology graduate courses are not open to graduate-level independent students, except in specific circumstances as defined by the department.
Upon recommendation of their thesis supervisor, students enrolled in the Master of Arts (Psychology) program at Concordia University who have completed a minimum of 12 credits of graduate level course work and who have shown high academic performance and potential through performance in research may apply for accelerated admission to doctoral studies without submitting a master’s thesis. Approval for accelerated admission must be obtained from the student’s thesis committee and the graduate admissions subcommittee by August 15 to allow entry into the PhD program in the Fall term. Students in the Research and Clinical Training option may not obtain accelerated admission to the PhD program from MA Year I, but may apply for accelerated admission, upon recommendation of their thesis supervisor, from MA Year II.
Proficiency in English. Applicants whose primary language is not English must demonstrate that their knowledge of English is sufficient to pursue graduate studies in their chosen field. Please refer to the  Graduate Admission page  for further information on the Language Proficiency requirements and exemptions.
Application process
Your completed application will include:
Application form and Fee
Curriculum Vitae (CV)
Three  Letters of Reference and  Academic Assessment forms  
Supplemental Letter of Recommendation form  for applicants to the Research and Clinical Training Option 
Statement of Purpose (1500 words) describing applicant's academic interest, primary area of concentration and research goals
Psychology Background Summary form
The Graduate Record Examination (GRE, aptitude and advanced) is recommended, but not required
Transcripts  for all post-secondary institutions attended
Proof of Canadian citizenship (if applicable)
Applicants whose primary language is not English, are required to submit  official language test scores , unless exempted.
