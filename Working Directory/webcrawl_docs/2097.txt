Irish Studies (BA. Cert)
Bachelor of Arts (BA), Certificate (Cert)
Offered by:
School of Irish Studies , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why choose Irish Studies?
Delving into the Irish experience will anchor and expand your understanding of the issues facing our planet today. The people of Ireland have a history that includes colonisation, famine, diaspora, civil war, partition, and the Troubles. Looking at what happened in Ireland can become the key to comprehending what’s at stake now as events like refugee crises, mass immigration and resettlement play out around the world.
Irish contributions to literature, music and dance have had a global reach, with an incredibly rich and unique history of their own.
Pursuing a degree in Irish Studies is the perfect way to weave your own tapestry of an educational experience, choosing from courses in political science, history, design, music, language, literature, theology, geography, and more.
Students who enroll in the programs of the School of Irish Studies benefit from small class sizes, the possibility of significant funding (Scholarships and Tuition Remission Awards, if you meet certain criteria), and the chance for funded travel to Ireland. The Irish Studies program is the only one of its kind in North America, allowing you to learn about Ireland and the experience of the Irish around the world.
