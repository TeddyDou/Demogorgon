Education
Ph.D. (Clinical Psychology, University of British Columbia)
B.Sc. (Psychology, University of Toronto)
Research interests
I received dual training in clinical psychology and cultural psychology, along with sustained exposure to the interdisciplinary field of transcultural psychiatry. As such, my scholarly work aims to integrate these disciplines, particularly through empirical contributions falling under two broad and interrelated themes. First, I study the cultural shaping of emotions and emotional disorders, with an emphasis on East Asian societies: China, Korea, and Japan. Second, I study the acculturation process and its implications for mental health in migrants to Montreal, focusing in particular on the development of better assessment tools to measure key aspects of acculturation. These two themes are united by the subfield of Cultural-Clinical Psychology, which I am helping to develop and promote through collaborative conceptual work.
