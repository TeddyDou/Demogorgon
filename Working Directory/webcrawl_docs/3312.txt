Yay!  More Malignant Remedy characters!
You’ll finally get a glimpse of the governing royal family.
This is supposed to be a painting King Burkhart commissioned of his son Prince Erith (heir to the throne) and his lovely daughter, Princess Lena.  They are both diplomatic souls with a competitive edge.  They have a tendency to teach one another how to self-improve, even if it’s not wanted.  They also have a shared interest in astronomy.  Oh…and did I mention they hold a high regard for each other, and are practically inseparable?
That’s all I can say~
Oh, so you like these characters, eh?  You think they look sweet?  Well that’s too bad…cause their world is about to be turned uPsIdE DoWn~
