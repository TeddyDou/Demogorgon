Since its inception in 2000, the annual festival has proudly exhibited art produced by Concordia students in the fields of visual art, design, cinema, dance, music, spoken word and theater. The Art Matters festival takes place in March and it features exhibitions organized and curated by Concordia students in venues throughout Montréal as well as other events such as artist discussions, workshops and vernissages.
