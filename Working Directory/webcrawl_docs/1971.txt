Religion (PhD)
Doctorate (PhD)
Offered by:
Department of Religions and Cultures , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why pursue a Doctorate in Religion?
The Department of Religions and Cultures is one of the largest in Canada, with faculty expertise in a variety of historical and geographical areas (e.g., Europe, North America, the Middle East, South and East Asia) and spanning multiple traditions including Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity, Judaism, and Islam.  We offer unique strengths in Canadian Jewish Studies, Religions and Cultures in Roman Late Antiquity, and Women, Gender and Sexuality, and Iranian Studies.
Our department offers an exceptional environment for graduate studies, where strong mentoring and a collegial environment are hallmarks of our doctoral program.  Students develop professional and transferable skills through involvement with its student journal and conference.
Many of our doctoral students have opportunities to design and teach their own courses, gaining professional experience that provides them with a competitive advantage in their careers.
Program Details
Degree requirements
Requirements for the Degree
Credits. A fully-qualified candidate is required to complete a minimum of 90 credits.
Doctoral Seminars. All candidates must register for RELI 890 (6 credits) in their first or second or equivalent year of study. This seminar will deal with general and methodological issues in the study of religion. It will be held in common with UQAM and Université Laval; discussion and readings will be both in English and in French. In the first or second or equivalent year of the program, the student will register as well for one of the following seminars according to their specialization: RELI 891, Comparative Religion and Ethics (6 credits), or RELI 892, Judaic Studies (6 credits).
Courses. A student is required to register for a minimum of 18 credits of directed reading. These courses are offered according to the resources of the department and the needs of the students. They are grouped into RELI 800-818 (Topics in Judaic Studies) and RELI 820-839 (Topics in Comparative Religion and Ethics). Some of the courses at the Master of Arts level are open to PhD candidates, with the requirement of additional work and higher standards of performance.
Comprehensive Examination. Graduate students in Religion at the doctoral level are expected to pursue a program of independent study and research in their chosen field. After course work is completed, all candidates must take RELI 860: Doctoral Comprehensive Examination (15 credits). The comprehensive examination will consist of three written exams followed by an oral examination which reviews these exams. In most cases, two of these written exams focus on topics from two distinct religious traditions; the third written exam will be on a topic related to a student’s proposed thesis. One of the three exams should include a focus on theory and methodology. Credits are not distributed among these four examinations. For purposes of registration, this work will be designated as RELI 860 and is graded as pass/fail.
Thesis. Each candidate will prepare a doctoral thesis which is to be an original contribution to scholarship. Although the topic should be provisionally chosen and serve as a coordinating factor throughout the student’s doctoral program, a written proposal must be formally submitted and approved by the Graduate Studies Committee after the successful completion of the comprehensive examination. For purposes of registration, the thesis will be designated as RELI 870: Doctoral Thesis (45 credits).
Language Requirement. Students must achieve an acceptable command of the classical and/or modern languages appropriate to their area of specialization. Specific requirements in terms of numbers of years of study and examinations or other demonstrations of competence are established in consultation with the Graduate Program Director and the thesis supervisor. Students are also expected to be proficient in the language or languages of the primary sources relevant to their thesis research. All Canadian students are required to demonstrate a working knowledge of both English and French.
Admission requirements
Admission Requirements. A Master of Arts in Religion, or equivalent, with high standing from a recognized university.
The Department will consider the application of students to the PhD program for entry without completion of the master’s degree if the following requirements are met:

the student has acquired a breadth of knowledge in the study of Religion through course work or scholarly or professional experience;
